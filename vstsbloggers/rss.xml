<item><title>Creating a TFS 2008 with SP1 Slipstreamed ISO image</title><link>http://www.woodwardweb.com/tfs/000444.html</link><description><![CDATA[Source: Martin Woodward. <p>Now that TFS 2008 SP1 is here, time to create a version of the TFS installer media that just contains the bits with SP1 applied.&#160; This is essential for installations targeting SQL Server 2008, but also makes the installation process onto Windows Server 2008 much easier and any installation faster (otherwise you have to install TFS 2008, then apply the service pack).&#160; Note that this is only required for new TFS installations - if you already have TFS installed then you are best of simply running the excellent service pack installer and it will do the business.&#160; Hopefully in a few weeks Microsoft will make a TFS 2008 with SP1 ISO image available, but in the meantime I thought I would write up the process of creating your own as I did mine.</p>  <p><strong>Update</strong>:&#160; After creating the patched install of everything and running it, there were errors for the Team Build and Proxy installers.&#160; Talking with fellow MVP <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/etiennetremblay/Default.aspx">Etienne Tremblay</a> this is apparently a known issue, documented as such (d'oh, I should really RTFM) and that slipstreaming of the Build and Proxy stuff is not supported at this present time.&#160; I've therefore updated this post to include the TFS SP1 rather than patched Build and Proxy installations so that you can do it the old fashioned way of installing, then patching...</p>  <p><strong>Pre-requisites</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>TFS 2008 Installation DVD (Workgroup, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=B0155166-B0A3-436E-AC95-37D7E39A440C&amp;displaylang=en">Trial</a> or Full) </li>    <li><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=124829">TFS 2008 Service Pack 1</a> </li>    <li>An iso creating tool (I will use <a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm">ISORecorder</a> because it is good, free and works on Windows Vista x64). </li>    <li>A couple of gigs worth of spare hard disk space to work in. </li> </ul>  <p><strong>Slipstreaming the TFS Installation Files</strong></p>  <ol>   <li>First, you must copy the contents of the TFS installation media onto a temporary folder on your hard drive. In my case I have created a folder called D:\tfs_sp1\source and copied the contents there.      <br /><a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/CreatingaTFS2008withSP1SlipstreamedISOim_96D9/source_2.png"><img style="float: none; margin-left: 25px" height="253" alt="D:\tfs_sp1\source" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/CreatingaTFS2008withSP1SlipstreamedISOim_96D9/source_thumb.png" width="325" /></a> </li>    <li>Extract the contents of the TFS installer executable by running the following command:      <br /><code>en_visual_studio_team_system_2008_team_foundation_server_service_pack_1_x86_x64wow.exe /extract:&lt;location&gt;</code>       <br /><a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/CreatingaTFS2008withSP1SlipstreamedISOim_96D9/Administrator%20Admin%20Cmd%20(2)_2.png"><img style="float: none; margin-left: 25px" height="318" alt="Administrator command shell running extract command." src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/CreatingaTFS2008withSP1SlipstreamedISOim_96D9/Administrator%20Admin%20Cmd%20(2)_thumb.png" width="500" /></a> </li>    <li>Run the following command to apply the patch to the contents of the main TFS application installation folder (AT):      <br /><code>msiexec /a &lt;RTM Source Dir&gt;\AT\vs_setup.msi /p TFS90sp1-KB949786.msp TARGETDIR=&lt;SP1 Target Dir&gt;\AT</code>       <br /><a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/CreatingaTFS2008withSP1SlipstreamedISOim_96D9/Administrator%20Admin%20Cmd%20(3)_2.png"><img style="float: none; margin-left: 25px" height="317" alt="Administrator command shell with AT patch command showing" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/CreatingaTFS2008withSP1SlipstreamedISOim_96D9/Administrator%20Admin%20Cmd%20(3)_thumb.png" width="500" /></a> </li>    <li>Note that slipstreaming the Build and Proxy installations is not supported at this time.&#160; Also, the sharepoint extensions folder&#160; (wssExt) does not need patching so we can just copy these over. </li>    <li>Because slipstreaming the Build and Proxy is not supported, you will also want to copy over the original service pack .exe file so that you can run it after installing them. </li>    <li>Also, the Team Foundation Server client (Team Explorer) requires Visual Studio 2008 SP1, not the service pack for TFS.&#160; If you installed Team Explorer without the service pack onto a SP1 server then bad things can happen (I've seen class serialization errors but you might see other symptoms) - therefore you might want to exclude the TFC folder from this SP1 disc so that you have to install it from a Visual Studio Team Suite disc instead - hopefully remembering to run Visual Studio SP1 afterwards.&#160; However if, like me, you frequently install Team Explorer onto your TFS servers so that you can manage them directly from the server then you might want to also include the offline installation for Visual Studio on your new ISO image, that way you can quickly get access to the service pack.&#160; To get hold of the offline installer, download the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=122095">Visual Studio 2008 SP1 iso image</a>, mount the image and then copy the vs90sp1 folder.&#160; </li>    <li>While you are at it, you might as well download the latest copy of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=ff12844f-398c-4fe9-8b0d-9e84181d9923">TFS Install Guide</a>.&#160; If you are really fancy you can copy all the files over from the root of the RTM source and edit the setup.ini file to point to the new version of the document (mine is TFSInstall-RTM-v080811.chm). </li>    <li>Now we have a nice little package that contains all the bits we need to install TFS SP1 onto a server.&#160; Mine looks like this:&#160; <br /><a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/CreatingaTFS2008withSP1SlipstreamedISOim_96D9/withsp1%20(2)_2.png"><img style="float: none; margin-left: 25px" height="353" alt="withsp1 (2)" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/CreatingaTFS2008withSP1SlipstreamedISOim_96D9/withsp1%20(2)_thumb.png" width="500" /></a>       <br />If we go look inside the AT folder and check the file versions, we can see which assemblies were patched.&#160; The TFS2008 RTM versions of the assemblies were 9.0.21022.8 but the TS 2008 SP1 versions are 9.0.30729.1       <br /><a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/CreatingaTFS2008withSP1SlipstreamedISOim_96D9/Tools_2.png"><img style="float: none; margin-left: 25px" height="246" alt="Tools" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/CreatingaTFS2008withSP1SlipstreamedISOim_96D9/Tools_thumb.png" width="600" /></a> </li>    <li>You could just burn the contents of your SP1 folder to a DVD, but I personally like to have it as an ISO image so that I can easily archive it and point to it from a Virtual PC. To create an ISO image using the excellent <a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/">ISORecorder</a> is very easy - just right click on your SP1 folder and select &quot;Create ISO Image&quot;.       <br /><a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/CreatingaTFS2008withSP1SlipstreamedISOim_96D9/CD%20Recording%20Wizard%20(2)_2.png"><img style="float: none; margin-left: 25px" height="309" alt="ISO Recorder" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/CreatingaTFS2008withSP1SlipstreamedISOim_96D9/CD%20Recording%20Wizard%20(2)_thumb.png" width="500" /></a> </li> </ol>  <p>And there you have it. A handy ISO image that should speed up your TFS installations no end.&#160; Happy installing!</p>]]></description></item>

<item><title>Behind Brian the Build Bunny</title><link>http://www.woodwardweb.com/tfs/000441.html</link><description><![CDATA[Source: Martin Woodward. <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is32fWJJA-I" target="_blank"><img height="250" alt="Watch the Brian the Build Bunny video in full" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/BehindBriantheBuildBunny_D2A9/brian_whiteboard_23c64a49-4965-4c8a-8355-e73a041120ab.gif" width="295" align="right" /></a> Since posting about <a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/gadgets/000434.html" target="_blank">Brian the Build Bunny</a>, I have been getting a steady stream of emails from people who would like to know more about how it works.</p>  <p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc507647.aspx" target="_blank">Team Foundation Server provides a mechanism by which you can subscribe to events when certain things happen</a>.&#160; This is actually how many of the components in TFS are integrated between themselves and like the rest of the TFS glue - Microsoft make these events available so you can customize your TFS instance.</p>  <p>At a high level, I purchased a <a href="http://www.nabaztag.com/" target="_blank">Nabaztag</a> bunny and decorated it with the Visual Studio logo and Brian the Build Bunny was born. The code behind Brian the Build Bunny is actually very simple, a web service (in my case sat in IIS on my TFS server) listens for the events and then converts this into a string on text which it sends to the Nabaztag servers.&#160; Nabaztag run this text through a Text to Speech engine and generate an MP3 file with the results, they then notify my build bunny about the MP3 file and he downloads the file over his WiFi connection and plays it on his speakers.</p>  <p>But if you want the full gory details then read on.</p> <p>  <h4>Brian the Build Bunny Project.</h4>  <p><strong>Pre-requisites:</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>1 Team Foundation Server instance (a VPC one to play with first is recommended) </li>    <li>1 Nabaztag bunny </li>    <li>1 Wifi connection to the internet for the bunny to use </li>    <li>1 sheet of clear labels (to print the Visual Studio logo as Brian's bow tie).&#160; I used Avery J8560, but then again I'm a crazy European with metric pages. </li> </ul>  <p><strong>Preparation:</strong></p>  <ol>   <li>Ensure your bunny is registered with Nabaztag and you have your serial number and API token. </li>    <li>Ensure your Team Foundation Server instance (or where-ever you want to host the &quot;bunny listener&quot;) code has internet access so that it is able to talk to the Nabaztag server.&#160; Try pasting the following URL into Internet Explorer on the TFS instance to make sure you can get out and talk to Nabaztag:      <br />      <pre>http://api.nabaztag.com/vl/FR/api.jsp?sn=SERIAL&amp;token=TOKEN&amp;voice=UK-Mistermuggles&amp;tts=Hello+my+name+is+Brian+the+Build+Bunny.</pre><br />Remembering to insert your build bunny's serial number and API token obtained when you registered your bunny with Nabaztag. </li></p><p>  <li>Download the image <a title="http://www.woodwardweb.com/brian/files/teamsystem.png" href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/brian/files/teamsystem.png" target="_blank">teamsystem.png</a> (70 KB) and print out the Team System logo on a clear label.&#160; Cut around the logo and stick onto your bunny to turn him into a smart looking Build Bunny. </li><br /></ol></p><p><strong>Code:</strong></p><p>You can download the example code using the following link, (VS 2008 project using C# in .NET 2.0):</p><p><a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/brian/files/BunnyLink.zip" target="_blank"><img style="float: none; margin-left: 25px" height="64" alt="sln_download" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/BehindBriantheBuildBunny_D2A9/sln_download_0e46ec2d-c737-4656-b8c6-533a3265a065.gif" width="250" /></a> </p><p>There are many ways to listen for Team Foundation Server SOAP events. You can have a &quot;proper&quot; web service living on IIS, or you have have a hosted WCF process listening to a particular port. In my particular case I was happy with the IIS approach and so used the excellent <a href="http://blogs.conchango.com/howardvanrooijen/archive/2007/06/14/TFS-Notification-Web-Services-Project-Template-v.1.2.aspx" target="_blank">Team Foundation Server Notification Event project template</a> from <a href="http://blogs.conchango.com/howardvanrooijen/" target="_blank">Howard van Rooijen</a> at <a href="http://www.conchango.com/" target="_blank">Conchango</a> as that's the fastest way to get up and running when doing this type of project.&#160; If you wanted to go down the WCF route then take a look at <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/hinshelm/" target="_blank">Martin Hinshelwood</a>'s <a href="http://codeplex.com/TFSEventHandler" target="_blank">TFS Event Handler project up on CodePlex</a>.</p><p>I created a quick class library that is a thin wrapper over the Nabaztag API, and exposes functionality via the Bunny class including building and sending of the HTTP message to the Nabaztag servers. <br/><img style="float: none; margin-left: 25px" height="207" alt="Bunny class diagram" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/BehindBriantheBuildBunny_D2A9/bunny_class_36af2a05-26b6-4a6b-a0cb-13a80ed07088.gif" width="481" />&#160; </p><p>I then created a TFS Web Services Notification project (using <a href="http://blogs.conchango.com/howardvanrooijen/archive/2007/06/14/TFS-Notification-Web-Services-Project-Template-v.1.2.aspx" target="_blank">Howard's template</a>).&#160; This gives me ready-made code to hook into various events - but I just wanted the build completion event and the check-in event for this example.</p><p>Build completion event:   <br /><img style="float: none; margin-left: 0px" height="471" alt="Build Completition Code" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/BehindBriantheBuildBunny_D2A9/build_notification_code_f23f6410-492f-4a29-b76b-a3c934369c59.gif" width="770" /></p><p>Check-in event:<br/><img style="float: none; margin-left: 0px" height="473" alt="Code executed on check-in event" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/BehindBriantheBuildBunny_D2A9/checkin_event_code_d3c033b2-085e-46d5-bc35-a9a1bce2e2d8.gif" width="772" /></p><p>As you can see, I really don't do that much - just build up a string based on the data in the TFS event and then send that string to the bunny.</p><p><strong>Subscribing the Bunny Listener to the TFS Events</strong></p><p>Finally, once the web services are ready and listening - I must now tell TFS to send a SOAP message to my web services at the appropriate time.&#160; To do this, I used the command line tool BisSubscribe.exe.&#160; This can be found on your TFS server in the %ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 Team Foundation Server\TF Setup directory. </p><p>If you open up a command prompt and cd to it then you can type:</p><p></p><pre>bissubscribe /eventType BuildCompletionEvent /address http://localhost:8181/bunnylisener/BuildCompletionEndpoint.asmx /deliveryType Soap /server http://localhost:8080bissubscribe /eventType CheckinEvent /address http://localhost:8181/bunnylisener/CheckInEndpoint.asmx /deliveryType Soap /server http://localhost:8080</pre><p>Where the webservices are running at <code>http://localhost:8181/bunnylistener</code>.</p><p><strong>Exercises for the Reader:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>As you can see, the code above is just a starter.&#160; There are many things that you can get this new notification device to do and the code above is designed more of a sample that I can use in a talk rather than full on production code. That said, if anyone is interested in starting up a CodePlex project around this then please drop me a line.&#160; However, the following things are on my TODO list:</p><ul>  <li>Subscribe to BuildCompletionEvent2 which has some more relevant information </li><p>  <li>Use the GlobalSecurityService API to obtain the users real names and speak those rather than the userid. </li></p><p>  <li>Store the bunny config data in web.config rather than hard-coding bunny details in BunnyConstants class </li></p><p>  <li>Allow multiple bunnies to be registered (perhaps with a UI), allow each voice to be separately configured </li></p><p>  <li>Make sending of messages to Nabaztag asynchronous </li><br /></ul></p><p>Additionally - rather than using the eventing service to trigger Brian on build completition events, it might be interesting to write the &quot;Bunny Link&quot; as a windows service and get it to subscribe to the build queue using the same API as demonstrated by my <a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/vsts/000395.html" target="_blank">Build Wallboard sample</a>.&#160; That way you could make Brian talk when a build was queued or many other things.</p><p>If anyone has any questions or would like more details then please drop me a line.</p>]]></description></item>

<item><title>Using 64-bit Windows Server 2008 as a Workstation OS, Part 1</title><link>http://blog.accentient.com/Using64bitWindowsServer2008AsAWorkstationOSPart1.aspx</link><description><![CDATA[Source: Accentient Blog. <p>I just replaced Windows Vista Ultimate x64 on my laptop with the 64 bit version ofWindows Server 2008. What prompted the change? Well, I was hoping to improve the lacklusterperformance of Vista. I would happily trade in the consumer goodies in Vista for betterproductivity. Unfortunately it seems to be an either/or proposition. But the mostcompelling reason for me was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-V" target="_blank">Hyper-V</a>,the new virtual server from Microsoft. I do a lot of work with virtual machines, mostlyto run a complete <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vsts2008/products/default.aspx" target="_blank">VisualStudio Team System</a> environment in a sandbox for development and training purposes.Although Virtual PC 2007 is a good product, Hyper-V seemed to offer better performanceand more flexibility with features like <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/roblarson/archive/2008/04/26/virtual-machine-snapshots-with-hyper-v.aspx" target="_blank">snapshots</a>.Hyper-V also supports 64-bit guest operating systems, while Virtual PC 2007 can onlyrun 32 bit OS’s.</p><p>After reading <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/enterprisedesktop/archives/2008/03/windows_worksta.html" target="_blank">thisarticle</a> I was convinced that Windows Server 2008 with Hyper-V was the setup forme. So, I took the plunge. In the next blog post, I’ll go over the process of installingWindows Server 2008 as a workstation OS (also dubbed Windows “Workstation” 2008).</p><p>By the way, I run a <a href="http://www.notebookreview.com/default.asp?newsID=3857" target="_blank">Dell830</a> laptop with an <a href="http://processorfinder.intel.com/details.aspx?sSpec=SLA44" target="_blank">IntelCore Duo T7500</a> mobile CPU and 4GB RAM. If your workstation does not support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware-assisted_virtualization" target="_blank">hardwarevirtualization</a>, then it won’t run Hyper-V. However, you can enjoy the benefitsof Windows “Workstation” 2008 and still run your virts using <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloadS/details.aspx?FamilyID=28c97d22-6eb8-4a09-a7f7-f6c7a1f000b5&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank">VirtualPC 2007 SP1</a>. Although Windows Server 2008 is not officially a supported host OSfor Virtual PC, it seems to work just fine.</p><img width="0" height="0" src="http://blog.accentient.com/aggbug.ashx?id=2981f277-206c-4ba4-ab9e-ae85b629e8d6" />]]></description></item>
<item><title>Rangers ship SQL load testing tool</title><link>http://blogs.msdn.com/jeffbe/archive/2008/07/13/rangers-ship-sql-load-testing-tool.aspx</link><description><![CDATA[Source: Jeff Beehler's Blog. <p>The Team System Rangers have shipped again!&#160; This time they’re have built on the success of the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/WCFLoadTest">WCF Load Testing Tool</a> and have applied that same approach to SQL.&#160; You can find this tool on our Codeplex site: <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/SQLLoadTest">SQL Load Test</a>. Here are the details from that site: </p><blockquote><p><b>Project Description </b></p><p>This tool takes a SQL Profiler trace file and generates a unit test that replays the same sequence of database calls found in the trace file. The unit test is designed to be used in a Visual Studio Load Test. The code generated is easily modifiable so that data variation can be introduced for the purpose of doing performance testing. The tool generates code for both Visual Studio 2005 and Visual Studio 2008. The source code is a Visual Studio 2005 project. The tool is still in pre-release stage of development.</p><p><b>Why Load Test SQL? </b></p><p>There is a lot of code out there that makes load testing the application very difficult. The most common type is a client application that contains direct database calls. The application however is not structured to allow the business logic to be exercised without the GUI. Another common scenario is a legacy application written in a language such as Visual Basic 6. In cases like these, it can be difficult to load test the application without a GUI test tool, which introduces other disadvantages. GUI test tools are notoriously difficult to use, generally lead to brittle tests and also have limitations in scaling the load injectors sufficiently to exercise the servers. This tool offers one possible alternative. You start with using the client application to generate a trace of the SQL statements which typically represent a usage scenario. You can then turn the trace into equivalent ADO.NET code program that can be used in a load test.</p><p><b>Tool Description </b></p><p>The tool generates a Visual Studio 2005/2008 Unit Test from a SQL Server Profiler trace. It extracts all the SQL statements and stored procedure calls from the trace and turns them into a single Visual Studio Unit Test, which can then be configured as a Visual Studio Load Test. The tool does not interact with the database itself when it analyzes the trace and generates the test code. It can therefore be used in “offline” scenarios. The generated code needs to be customized to include a connection string to the database under test. That code also includes hooks to allow the user to customize the parameters that are passed to the SQL statements and stored procedures, so that variability can be introduced into the data to prevent caching from producing artificially high performance figures. The tool is intended to be used in conjunction with a client program that runs against a database. A trace of the client’s SQL Server activity is captured using the SQL Server Profiler. This represents a test scenario, which is then processed by the tool to produce a Unit Test that replays the scenario.</p></blockquote><p>Congratulations to the various Rangers involved in this project!&#160; Please check it out and let us know what you think.&#160; </p><img src="http://blogs.msdn.com/aggbug.aspx?PostID=8728540" width="1" height="1">]]></description></item>

<item><title>Teamprise 3.1 is now available</title><link>http://www.woodwardweb.com/teamprise/000440.html</link><description><![CDATA[Source: Martin Woodward. <p>At the Microsoft <a href="https://partner.microsoft.com/global/40018508" target="_blank">Worldwide Partner Conference</a> in Houston today, Corey Steffen (General Manager of Teamprise and the guy that pays my wages) announced the <a href="http://www.teamprise.com/" target="_blank">public availability of Teamprise 3.1</a>.</p>  <p>This is a maintenance release free to everyone with a valid Teamprise 3.0 license and includes several bug fixes along with a few new features.&#160; For the proper release notes, take a look <a href="http://download-us.teamprise.com/cs/3.1.0.8392R/release-notes/release-notes.html" target="_blank">here</a>.&#160; However I just wanted to point out a few highlights.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/Teamprise3.1isnowavailable_C053/online_2.png"><img height="97" alt="New Online dialog" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/Teamprise3.1isnowavailable_C053/online_thumb.png" width="200" align="right" /></a> </p>  <h4>Improved Offline Support</h4>  <p>With-out doubt, the biggest new feature in Teamprise 3.1 for most people will be the improved offline support. If you right click on a project in the Eclipse IDE, you are now presented with a &quot;Go Offline&quot; option which allows you to tell Teamprise not to bother trying to talk to TFS for a while (previously you had to restart Eclipse for Teamprise to ask you if you wanted to go offline, and only then after it had tried *really* hard to connect).</p>  <p>While offline, you can still perform all the file operations like you expect -- you can add, edit, move and delete files just like if you were online.</p>  <p>When you want to come back online (say when you have stepped back out of the plane, bus, meeting room), you can right click on the project and say &quot;Return Online&quot; and Teamprise will do it's best to detect what changes have happened while you were away, giving you the option to pend those changes.</p>  <p>There is even &quot;return online&quot; capability in the stand-alone client Teamprise Explorer which is very neat and makes working with tools that are not TFS aware a little easier too.&#160; The actual algorithm used by the return online feature is more sophisticated than just checking for read/write status in your local workspace, we also do some magic and compare checksums of the file contents etc.&#160; Fellow Teamprise blogger <a href="http://www.edwardthomson.com/blog/" target="_blank">Ed Thomson</a> was the lead developer for the offline work and he has some <a href="http://www.edwardthomson.com/blog/2008/07/teamprise_31.html" target="_blank">more details on his blog</a>.</p>  <h4>TFS 2008 SP1 New Feature Support</h4>  <p>Service Pack 1 of Team Foundation Server 2008 is hopefully due out soon, and with it come <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/archive/2008/04/28/team-foundation-server-2008-sp1.aspx" target="_blank">lots of lovely new features</a>. We took advantage in the timing of our 3.1 release to update Teamprise to support some of the new server capabilities so that they are available to our customers as soon as TFS 2008 SP1 arrives.&#160; These include:</p>  <ul>   <li>Last check-in date/time column (<a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/teamprise/000436.html" target="_blank">see my previous post about this feature</a>) </li>    <li>Support for work item meta-data filtering option (note that this option is already being used on some of the CodePlex servers so if you use Teamprise to talk to the work item functionality in CodePlex then you probably want to upgrade to Teamprise 3.1, <a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/teamprise/000339.html" target="_blank">after all the price is right</a> :-) ).</li>    <li><code>tf branch -checkin</code> command, the fastest way to create large branches and perform the check-in at the same time. </li> </ul>  <h4>Command Line Client Improvements</h4>  <p>In this release we are making publicly available a bunch of improvement and new features that we added to our command line client after some great feedback from one particular customer who has un-questionably the largest and most demanding Team Foundation Server install base on the planet. In particular we have added the &quot;-format:xml&quot; option for most commands in addition to the usual -format:brief and -format:detailed.&#160; The -format:xml option will output data from the command line client in a format easily XML parseable without truncating output which makes it much easier to use and parse command line output in scripting scenarios.&#160; However, there have been many more improvements so check out the <a href="http://download-us.teamprise.com/cs/3.1.0.8392R/release-notes/release-notes.html" target="_blank">release notes</a> for more information.</p>  <p><img height="195" alt="Look Ma, no asterisk" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/Teamprise3.1isnowavailable_C053/te64bit_2fb716f9-a6d9-4d6b-8bf9-3e08825e3fc6.png" width="240" align="right" /></p>  <h4>64-bit support on Windows.</h4>  <p>Not really worth calling out separately only to say that Teamprise is now <strong>the world's first commercially available x64 TFS client for Windows</strong> :-) </p>  <p>While we are a Java application, <a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/java/000223.html" target="_blank">as mentioned before</a>, we have a bit of JNI code to do the stuff not possible from all the JRE versions that we support (such as native authentication on Windows or making a file writable).&#160; Also we use SWT to give us a native look and feel on all platforms and SWT works by using lots of JNI to do the presentation calls.&#160; This meant that if you tried to run Teamprise under a x64 Java runtime we died pretty quickly.&#160; We've had x64 support available for other platforms for a while (including Linux), but with Windows x64 support coming in Eclipse 3.4 we took the opportunity to compile our JNI code over to the Win32 x64 architecture and it works great.</p>  <p>On a personal note, during this activity I had to fix some bits in the core Eclipse 3.4 codebase (specifically PDE for people that are interested) and the small patches that I submitted have been applied into the main Eclipse project which is a nice feeling. Eclipse is a poster-child of open source projects and it is with some pride that I can tell people I have contributed code into it. It's also nice that as Teamprise is a commercial company that uses a lot of the Eclipse code and is an Eclipse Foundation member, we are able to do our bit and contribute something back for the benefit of all.</p>  <p>As you can see, we've been busy. We've hopefully cleared some adoption blockers for some of our customers, done quite a few bug fixes and performance improvements and thrown in some new features along the way.&#160; While the headline grabbing features of interest to most people are probably the offline support and the 64-bit support, I'm very proud of this as a solid &quot;point&quot; release and I would encourage everyone with a valid 3.0 license to upgrade.</p>]]></description></item>
