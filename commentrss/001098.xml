    <description>Martin,

I will have to disagree about branches being used 1% of time. In enterprise level SCM branching is done frequently, and ability to view branching information and perform merges conveniently is a major selling point (ClearCase comes to my mind). May be that function falls into release managener domain and not developer, but you cannot just dismiss it.
I cannot emphasize enough how many of (prospective) clients have expressed dissatisfaction with current level of branch and merge data detalization in TFS.
So I do hope MS people will read my comment as well...</description>

    <description>One thing to note for folks that get deep into branching and merging is that a baseless merge (tf merge /baseless ...) will create merge relationships that will not show up in the Branches tab.

    <description>Coding Horror just published an article about source control with some recommended reading.

http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000660.html

Amongst them are your own Eric Sink&apos;s Source Control HOWTO : 
http://www.ericsink.com/scm/source_control.html

and a branching and Merging Primer : http://blogs.msdn.com/chrisbirmele/archive/2006/05/31/611179.aspx

Thought they might interest anyone reading this post.</description>

    <description>Full history including operations made on previous branches is not something I could live without.

So I developed an Add-in for VS that return the minimal functionality which was exist in VSS.

I have shared this Add-in as an open source project called        TFSBranchHistory and you can find it here:

Hope it will help someone. and everyone invited to join and improve it.</description>
