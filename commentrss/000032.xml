    <description>Marti,
   I thought us Brits liked our beer/lager cold, and the Yanks preferred it warm.

    <description>Martin,
Saw your post on sans.org.  This kb article will probably help with the wifi problem.

    <description>Oi Martin,
word on the street says you&apos;re buggering off to Ireland. When are we going to have a beer then?

    <description>Oh l&apos;ve have just read tim&apos;s diary. am now vv depressed.

as ever living up to the Briget Jones stereotype.

how was chicago?

This is a cool site. Am reading about eXtreme programming and feeling a little incompetent. probably should never have left the comfort of the dadp.

Hope all is well.

    <description>Had some stuff which has delayed my trip to Chicago - going at the end of November now.  Looking forward to it.  Currently working for a company that are big believers of the benefits of Agile methodologies and tools, rather than wanting rapid development but not putting and development into the supporting processes...  Big emphasis on the repeatability of success, which is nice!

Oh yes, one of the big Agile principles is that work should be fun.  So far it is.

Glad you are living up to Ms Jones.  Hope the new job is working out.

Cheers,

Martin.</description>

    <description>Thanks.  Don&apos;t know how you found me - I&apos;m now on the second page of Google.  Or is this just some comments spam?

If so, have I now spammed myself?  Who cares.</description>

    <description>Hey Martin!

Didn&apos;t check back to see what your reply was until now.

I am working in a company that pays lip service to what you&apos;re company seems to be doing, consequently it is a birrova nightmare. In fact looking for new job!

(so if you know anyone who needs someone as incompetent as I am.)

How you doing?

How was chicago, if you got there in the end.

how is northern Ireland? Can&apos;t believe it snowed for you. vv envious. I am going with Steve ET climbing in Scotland in March we are concerned that by then tropical weather will have hit us and we won&apos;t get to sleep in a snow-hole! 

anyway, do you have an email address? perhaps that would be less bonkers than posting messages on your site (which is very cool and I&apos;m learning loads by looking at the code you&apos;ve put up!)

See you later

Livi 
( I am assuming that you remember that I was your top test manager. (ho ho ho) and not some random web-stalker. although I believe if you don&apos;t have your own random web-stalker you can&apos;t really call yourself a geek (!))

    <description>I can be emailed on anything AT woodwardweb.com in case anyone want&apos;s to catch up.  

I once had an web-stalker, probably one of the first I would think.  In early 1995 I had put up some pictures on my second ever website (my first was a shrine to Cindy Crawford, but that is another story).  Some chick from the US decided to email me to say hi, that she &quot;liked my cute butt&quot; and asking me to write back as she had nothing else to do all day but surf the internet... 

Obviously, I&apos;m just too good looking, hence why I don&apos;t post pictures of myself anymore. </description>
