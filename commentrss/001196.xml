    <description>I agree with you on everything you say.

I recently switched to SongBird for my music. Already at version 0.6 and 0.7beta is much better than iTunes.

I had several Issues on the past with iTunes.

Here are some examples:
- Removing iTunes from a Windows machine after restarting my cd-rom disappear.
I resolved removing GEARAspiWDM from the registry at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{bunch of numbers} (look for the one that show CD-ROM on the right pannel.
- I also had the same problem you had on one of your post about been unable to close it so I had to disable the Bonjour service.
- Is slow like hell when you have a lot of music.
- And the last one was that I tried to share the same external hard drive with Windows and Mac and use iTunes in both with the same library.
After a few test my pc crash.
After rebooting it say &quot;Verifying DMI pool data&quot; and then it hang.
I had to re-install everything.

I hate it.</description>
