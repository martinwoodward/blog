    <description>Agile techniques are worthwhile in any project, but a big problem in software project management is that the technology is changing so quickly.

This is great for keeping the stuff interesting and fun (sometimes). But if you are laying bricks, it would be good to know that the latest version of the Earth (or the bricks) doesn&apos;t have any &apos;new features&apos;.</description>

    <description>Martin, although I know what you mean about estimating software development projects--I tend to lean toward the thought that as you gain experience this sort of things becomes easier, and guesstimating a project based on previous experience usually works well for me. I have learned the hard way to tack on 10% time/money to my guesstimates though for those unforeseen &quot;firewall&quot; issues.</description>

    <description>Martin - great post, the sudoku analogy is a lovely one.  My friends and family frequently don&apos;t understand it when I talk about planning and scheduling of software projects.

&quot;Oh, so you&apos;re going to have it done by then?&quot;  they ask.  My response is always &quot;I hope so!&quot;

Next time, I&apos;ll give them the sudoku analogy!</description>

    <description>I often apply the principle: A good developer should do this in X days. In the end I double all the numbers and add an additional margin of 10%. So far it often was succesfull for my type of IT projects (package integration and customisation) which mostly take around 6 months in duration.</description>
