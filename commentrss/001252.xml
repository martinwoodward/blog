    <description>Hi Martin,

Great example!  Would you happen to know how to replace the &quot;Queue New Build&quot; popup menu item when you right-click on a build definition from the Team Explorer window.  I have written a custom add-in form, and I want to use my own form when the user clicks to queue a new build.

Thanks in advance for any advice you might have.

    <description>*Replacing* the form would be difficult. It should be possible to contribute extensions to the Team Explorer context menu in Visual Studio but I would have to dig around to get that to work.

What I have seen people do in the past when they have some complex build queuing requirements is to disable build queuing permissions for nearly everyone and then have a web form that people have to go to when queuing a build.

Can I ask why the built in dialog doesn&apos;t work for you?

    <description>Hi Martin,

I am creating a custom application to queue builds. 

If my build config file includes running tests, is there a way to programatically get back the test results, code coverage results and the code analysis results?

Thanks!</description>
