    <description>I was just trying to get some backups configured and I wanted a way of deleting files from a directory stucture that were older than a certain date. I couldn&apos;t figure out how to do it easier from a Windows...</description>

    <description>Ah, pity you&apos;re not using OS X - you could use Automator at a fraction of the effort, and even use it to create plug-ins to other apps ;-)

    <description>Actually, that reminds me of my old job. I&apos;d set up a CVS repository, and one guy on the team was a dimwit, and kept on checking in stuff he shouldn&apos;t. He was continually asking me to get rid of it, and it started to p*ss me off. He came over one day after doing the same thing twice in one morning, so I SSHd to the box and went to clear the new directory he&apos;d created, using:

rm -rf /home/cvsroot/project/spanner

unfortunately (and I don&apos;t know why I typed the full path in anyway - saved doing a cd I guess) I actually typed:

rm -rf / home/cvsroot/project/spanner

(note the space!)

I realised my mistake when pages of deleted files went flying past my eyes!</description>

    <description>Thank you Martin,

Just what I was looking for. I added my logging class and popped it into my code.
