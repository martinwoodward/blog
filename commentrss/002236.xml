    <description>I have a theory of where this is going. Let&apos;s see if you prove me wrong:

1. Embrace: have a solution that offers cross-platform bug-tracking and version-control, so people would start using Microsoft tools

2. Extend: In the following versions, Windows clients would work better and support more features than non-Windows clients, so people would pay buy Windows instead of other platforms

3. Extinguish: kill support for cross-platform altogether - only Windows clients would be supported</description>

    <description>@AP - I&apos;ll let you judge us by our actions, but I&apos;m confident that we&apos;ll prove you wrong.  While it is true that the Visual Studio version will probably always have some additional features (such as being able to administer TFS), the Eclipse plug-in will continue to offer the functionality that makes most sense for the Eclipse developer to be able to contribute as a peer with Team Foundation Server.  In fact in some cases there will be features that exist only in the plug-in or on cross-platform clients because they make more sense to those developers.

The thing that impressed me the most about the team, and the thing that ultimately convinced me to join Microsoft, was the fact that they are truly committed to ensuring that all members of the software development project can collaborate with TFS as the central server for communication.  There is also the fact that Microsoft themselves are dependent on the cross-platform capabilities to develop other software that they sell and support as they use TFS internally on many projects.

Anyway - be sure to check back with me in the years to come and let me know how you think we are doing.</description>
