    <description>Seriously, it is one of the coolest places I have worked in my entire life.  The developers and PM&apos;s you meet are just top-notch folks that just get it.

Just because I have a soft spot for Java doesn&apos;t mean I cannot recognise talented people when I meet them.  But then again I&apos;ve always had a soft spot for the dark side...

I also got to have a look round the Amazon HQ in Seattle.  That was good fun also.</description>
