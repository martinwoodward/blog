    <description>I wrote a similar thing a while ago that ran on a thread and tested my webhost&apos;s webserver periodically. I amassed a bunch of data showing their server&apos;s uptime and downtime. I was constantly complaining that my site was down often, and they claimed it was &quot;my code&quot;. By showing logs of their server&apos;s activity and also logs of the amount of times they restarted their servlet engine, I could prove that not only was it their fault that the server was down, but also that they were lying about how often they restarted the servlet engine.</description>
