    <description>The source control system within Visual Studio Team System has a very powerful security model. One of the nice things is that if a user does not have read permissions on one of the objects in a tree, then that...</description>

    <description>Why isn&apos;t there an option to copy the inherited permissions when you stop inheriting? NTFS permissions does exactly that.</description>

    <description>Time, I guess :-)  But you are right - that would be good from a usability point of view.</description>

    <description>Couple things to note:

1) As long as you know the path ($/foo/bar) and you are an admin, you can use the command-line (in Beta 3 and final) to change the permissions still (granting yourself Read again, for instance)

2) We&apos;ve made a fix so that admins will see such items in the UI regardless of whether they currently have Read permission or not, for exactly this reason.

I&apos;m not sure about the copying of inherited permissions - it seems like a good idea, and it may just be an oversight, I&apos;ve forwarded it along to the responsible dev to find out.</description>

    <description>On the copy-inherited-permissions-when-you-stop-inheriting, I&apos;ve checked and it appears it&apos;s just an oversight on our part, unfortunately.  It&apos;s not likely to make the bar given how close we are to shipping, but it&apos;s likely to make V2.</description>

    <description>Just to confirm, we&apos;ve decided to postpone the copy inherited permissions, but it&apos;s a filed bug now and it&apos;ll be considered (and should be likely) for V2.

Thanks, Rein!</description>
