    <description>Well, I figured this one out, but I would like to see if it is possible to take it one step further.

I have configured the same for my CI builds and my Dailys. I would like to make my release versions manual, but I would like to drop them in a location with the label name (\\jeeves\drop\release\2.0.3.1\. I was wondering if there was a task that would build the labeled version then drop it in the folder with the same label name. To avoid confusion, I want to drop the date suffix as well. Do you think this is possible?</description>
