    <description>I spent a couple of months investigating thread starvation issues in an old job a few years ago. I did have peculiar dreams during that time too, as I was thinking about the work most of the time.

Deadlock happens in J2EE world quite a lot if you&apos;re not too careful with transaction demarcation. I&apos;ve seen a bunch of code written that produces spurious deadlocks, and it seems to have always been bad transaction demarcation.</description>

    <description>The VIC 20 was my first computer too, though I&apos;d never seen that Shatner commercial.  Good stuff.  My dad had a handful of Epson machines running CP/M for his business, and occasionally he brought one home and I&apos;d play with it a bit, but the VIC 20 was the first machine that was really mine.  I&apos;ll never forget waiting for what seemed like hours to load a BASIC program off the cassette drive, or typing thousands of lines out of Byte magazine followed by days trying to fix whatever I&apos;d gotten wrong.  Good memories!

    <description>That&apos;s how I learnt how to debug.  A couple of times it was actually the program in the magazine that was wrong - they were the best ones to figure out but they would take weeks.</description>

    <description>Vic-20... What?  No Apple IIe programmers here?  I think there are printouts of these programs at my parents house somewhere.

Ahh.  Those were the days.  I remember begging and pleading for my folks to spend that money on the 5.25&quot; disk drive.</description>
