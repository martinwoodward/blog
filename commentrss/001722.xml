    <description>I used this tip to set the attachment size to 10 MB using 10485760 as the value in the Invoke textbox. I then clicked on invoke &amp; then a new browser page was displayed with nothing in it.

I did log into the TFS server machine as a member of the adminstrators group.

Am I supposed to restart any services or reboot the server?  I tried rebooting once but the max attachment size was still being referenced as 4MB on the attachment tab screen when I went into the TFS webpage &amp; attempted to attach a 8 MB file to a bug work item. On my attempt, I got an error that the attachment size was exceeded.

Any clues?</description>
