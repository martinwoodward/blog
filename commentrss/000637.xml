    <description>Excellent recommendation - I usually end up recommending &quot;branches&quot; instead of &quot;branch&quot;, but that&apos;s likely just leftover from the &quot;trunk/tags/branches&quot; chants from svn where I first picked it up (http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.1/ch05s04.html)

Since we both do namespace branching, I&apos;ve actually recommended that svnbook page to a couple of friends that asked for quick recommendations on setting up new projects in TF :)</description>

    <description>What would you do with Build files?  These files would be placed above the trunk folder, yet the build information should be inside the trunk (or its branch).  I&apos;m not sure there is a good answer, but was wondering if you had any thoughts on this.</description>

    <description>Yeah - that is a good question.  We don&apos;t curently use TeamBuild so I don&apos;t have a good answer for you there.  

For the build server that we do have we (as you point out) manage our builds  using files that are in a folder inside the trunk folder.

    <description>We use this structure:

$/Branches
$/Branches/BugFix
$/Branches/Feature
$/Branches/Release
$/Main/Doc
$/Main/Imports
$/Main/Prototypes
$/Main/Samples
$/Main/Src
$/Main/Test
$/Main/Tools
$/Main/UserDoc

I view Release branches as just another branch but perhaps there&apos;s a discoverability benefit to moving Release branches up to the top.  I also like &quot;Main&quot; over trunk.  It is shorter and more importantly IMO places the proper emphasis on the &quot;main&quot; branch.  :-)</description>

    <description>Do you put your .sln solution file in the trunk folder, and the .csproj project files in each project folder?

When you branch, do you right-click on the trunk folder and branch from there?</description>

    <description>Dan,

Good point.  I do it like this:-

$/TeamProject/trunk/Solution1/sol.sln
$/TeamProject/trunk/Solution1/Project1/proj1.csproj
$/TeamProject/trunk/Solution1/Project2/proj2.vbproj

Often a TeamProject can contain multiple solutions, Java Projects etc.

When I branch, I typically branch from trunk upwards, that way everything under trunk is branched - i.e all the projects.

If you just have one solution under your Team Project then this may well be overkill - but worth doing if you have more than one solution.

Hope that helps,

Martin.

    <description>Hi,

I need recommendation for following scenario. 

We have outsourced a project. Should we create 2 branches ? what do you recommend when there are multiple countries involved in development and the projects in diff. countries are supposed to be readonly. 

thanks

    <description>Paresh,

Take a look at the TFS Branching Guidance on CodePlex and see if that helps with your scenario.

Good luck,

Martin.</description>
