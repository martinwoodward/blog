    <description>Hi!

I have also installed vista successfully on my Mac mini. But there still is one annoying problem, the Intel 950 driver. Using the Microsoft driver it works well, but sometimes the computer goes blue screen. Using the latest Intel driver I get some really annoying flicker while moving windows and watching a movie at the same time. The intel driver also go blue screen sometimes.

Would be great to know if you have had any blue screens and how much ram you have installed (since vista allocates up to 256mb video ram).

    <description>Hey Johan,

I haven&apos;t had a single blue screen of death yet.  I used the standard drivers that got installed with Vista and haven&apos;t but any others on.  The machine does have 2Gb Ram installed though which may explain our different experiences.  Also,I made sure I had the latest version of the firmware and the latest version of BootCamp that I could get my hands on.

I&apos;ll take a look in more detail and let you know if I find anything else (or if I get a BSOD).

Martin.</description>

    <description>Yup - did a clean install and I have done for all my Vista migrations even on more standard hardware.  The upgrades of old scared me off doing one as it tends to leave lots of old stuff in the registry etc - I took the opportunity of a new OS to clean out my system with fresh software.

I&apos;ve heard people doing the upgrade to Vista and it has gone ok, but something I have never tried personally.</description>
