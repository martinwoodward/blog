<title>Creating a TFS 2008 with SP1 Slipstreamed ISO image</title>
<link>http://www.woodwardweb.com/tfs/000444.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>Now that TFS 2008 SP1 is here, time to create a version of the TFS installer media that just contains the bits with SP1 applied.&#160; This is essential for installations targeting SQL Server 2008, but also makes the installation process onto Windows Server 2008 much easier and any installation faster (otherwise you have to install TFS 2008, then apply the service pack).&#160; Note that this is only required for new TFS installations - if you already have TFS installed then you are best of simply running the excellent service pack installer and it will do the business.&#160; Hopefully in a few weeks Microsoft will make a TFS 2008 with SP1 ISO image available, but in the meantime I thought I would write up the process of creating your own as I did mine.</p>  <p><strong>Update</strong>:&#160; After creating the patched install of everything and running it, there were errors for the Team Build and Proxy installers.&#160; Talking with fellow MVP <a href="http://geekswithblogs.net/etiennetremblay/Default.aspx">Etienne Tremblay</a> this is apparently a known issue, documented as such (d'oh, I should really RTFM) and that slipstreaming of the Build and Proxy stuff is not supported at this present time.&#160; I've therefore updated this post to include the TFS SP1 rather than patched Build and Proxy installations so that you can do it the old fashioned way of installing, then patching...</p>  <p><strong>Pre-requisites</strong></p>  <ul>   <li>TFS 2008 Installation DVD (Workgroup, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=B0155166-B0A3-436E-AC95-37D7E39A440C&amp;displaylang=en">Trial</a> or Full) </li>    <li><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=124829">TFS 2008 Service Pack 1</a> </li>    <li>An iso creating tool (I will use <a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm">ISORecorder</a> because it is good, free and works on Windows Vista x64). </li>    <li>A couple of gigs worth of spare hard disk space to work in. </li> </ul>  <p><strong>Slipstreaming the TFS Installation Files</strong></p>  <ol>   <li>First, you must copy the contents of the TFS installation media onto a temporary folder on your hard drive. In my case I have created a folder called D:\tfs_sp1\source and copied the contents there.      <br /><a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/CreatingaTFS2008withSP1SlipstreamedISOim_96D9/source_2.png"><img style="float: none; margin-left: 25px" height="253" alt="D:\tfs_sp1\source" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/CreatingaTFS2008withSP1SlipstreamedISOim_96D9/source_thumb.png" width="325" /></a> </li>    <li>Extract the contents of the TFS installer executable by running the following command:      <br /><code>en_visual_studio_team_system_2008_team_foundation_server_service_pack_1_x86_x64wow.exe /extract:&lt;location&gt;</code>       <br /><a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/CreatingaTFS2008withSP1SlipstreamedISOim_96D9/Administrator%20Admin%20Cmd%20(2)_2.png"><img style="float: none; margin-left: 25px" height="318" alt="Administrator command shell running extract command." src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/CreatingaTFS2008withSP1SlipstreamedISOim_96D9/Administrator%20Admin%20Cmd%20(2)_thumb.png" width="500" /></a> </li>    <li>Run the following command to apply the patch to the contents of the main TFS application installation folder (AT):      <br /><code>msiexec /a &lt;RTM Source Dir&gt;\AT\vs_setup.msi /p TFS90sp1-KB949786.msp TARGETDIR=&lt;SP1 Target Dir&gt;\AT</code>       <br /><a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/CreatingaTFS2008withSP1SlipstreamedISOim_96D9/Administrator%20Admin%20Cmd%20(3)_2.png"><img style="float: none; margin-left: 25px" height="317" alt="Administrator command shell with AT patch command showing" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/CreatingaTFS2008withSP1SlipstreamedISOim_96D9/Administrator%20Admin%20Cmd%20(3)_thumb.png" width="500" /></a> </li>    <li>Note that slipstreaming the Build and Proxy installations is not supported at this time.&#160; Also, the sharepoint extensions folder&#160; (wssExt) does not need patching so we can just copy these over. </li>    <li>Because slipstreaming the Build and Proxy is not supported, you will also want to copy over the original service pack .exe file so that you can run it after installing them. </li>    <li>Also, the Team Foundation Server client (Team Explorer) requires Visual Studio 2008 SP1, not the service pack for TFS.&#160; If you installed Team Explorer without the service pack onto a SP1 server then bad things can happen (I've seen class serialization errors but you might see other symptoms) - therefore you might want to exclude the TFC folder from this SP1 disc so that you have to install it from a Visual Studio Team Suite disc instead - hopefully remembering to run Visual Studio SP1 afterwards.&#160; However if, like me, you frequently install Team Explorer onto your TFS servers so that you can manage them directly from the server then you might want to also include the offline installation for Visual Studio on your new ISO image, that way you can quickly get access to the service pack.&#160; To get hold of the offline installer, download the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=122095">Visual Studio 2008 SP1 iso image</a>, mount the image and then copy the vs90sp1 folder.&#160; </li>    <li>While you are at it, you might as well download the latest copy of the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=ff12844f-398c-4fe9-8b0d-9e84181d9923">TFS Install Guide</a>.&#160; If you are really fancy you can copy all the files over from the root of the RTM source and edit the setup.ini file to point to the new version of the document (mine is TFSInstall-RTM-v080811.chm). </li>    <li>Now we have a nice little package that contains all the bits we need to install TFS SP1 onto a server.&#160; Mine looks like this:&#160; <br /><a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/CreatingaTFS2008withSP1SlipstreamedISOim_96D9/withsp1%20(2)_2.png"><img style="float: none; margin-left: 25px" height="353" alt="withsp1 (2)" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/CreatingaTFS2008withSP1SlipstreamedISOim_96D9/withsp1%20(2)_thumb.png" width="500" /></a>       <br />If we go look inside the AT folder and check the file versions, we can see which assemblies were patched.&#160; The TFS2008 RTM versions of the assemblies were 9.0.21022.8 but the TS 2008 SP1 versions are 9.0.30729.1       <br /><a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/CreatingaTFS2008withSP1SlipstreamedISOim_96D9/Tools_2.png"><img style="float: none; margin-left: 25px" height="246" alt="Tools" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/CreatingaTFS2008withSP1SlipstreamedISOim_96D9/Tools_thumb.png" width="600" /></a> </li>    <li>You could just burn the contents of your SP1 folder to a DVD, but I personally like to have it as an ISO image so that I can easily archive it and point to it from a Virtual PC. To create an ISO image using the excellent <a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/">ISORecorder</a> is very easy - just right click on your SP1 folder and select &quot;Create ISO Image&quot;.       <br /><a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/CreatingaTFS2008withSP1SlipstreamedISOim_96D9/CD%20Recording%20Wizard%20(2)_2.png"><img style="float: none; margin-left: 25px" height="309" alt="ISO Recorder" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/CreatingaTFS2008withSP1SlipstreamedISOim_96D9/CD%20Recording%20Wizard%20(2)_thumb.png" width="500" /></a> </li> </ol>  <p>And there you have it. A handy ISO image that should speed up your TFS installations no end.&#160; Happy installing!</p>]]></description>

<title>Teamprise 3.1 is now available</title>
<link>http://www.woodwardweb.com/teamprise/000440.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p>At the Microsoft <a href="https://partner.microsoft.com/global/40018508" target="_blank">Worldwide Partner Conference</a> in Houston today, Corey Steffen (General Manager of Teamprise and the guy that pays my wages) announced the <a href="http://www.teamprise.com/" target="_blank">public availability of Teamprise 3.1</a>.</p>  <p>This is a maintenance release free to everyone with a valid Teamprise 3.0 license and includes several bug fixes along with a few new features.&#160; For the proper release notes, take a look <a href="http://download-us.teamprise.com/cs/3.1.0.8392R/release-notes/release-notes.html" target="_blank">here</a>.&#160; However I just wanted to point out a few highlights.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/Teamprise3.1isnowavailable_C053/online_2.png"><img height="97" alt="New Online dialog" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/Teamprise3.1isnowavailable_C053/online_thumb.png" width="200" align="right" /></a> </p>  <h4>Improved Offline Support</h4>  <p>With-out doubt, the biggest new feature in Teamprise 3.1 for most people will be the improved offline support. If you right click on a project in the Eclipse IDE, you are now presented with a &quot;Go Offline&quot; option which allows you to tell Teamprise not to bother trying to talk to TFS for a while (previously you had to restart Eclipse for Teamprise to ask you if you wanted to go offline, and only then after it had tried *really* hard to connect).</p>  <p>While offline, you can still perform all the file operations like you expect -- you can add, edit, move and delete files just like if you were online.</p>  <p>When you want to come back online (say when you have stepped back out of the plane, bus, meeting room), you can right click on the project and say &quot;Return Online&quot; and Teamprise will do it's best to detect what changes have happened while you were away, giving you the option to pend those changes.</p>  <p>There is even &quot;return online&quot; capability in the stand-alone client Teamprise Explorer which is very neat and makes working with tools that are not TFS aware a little easier too.&#160; The actual algorithm used by the return online feature is more sophisticated than just checking for read/write status in your local workspace, we also do some magic and compare checksums of the file contents etc.&#160; Fellow Teamprise blogger <a href="http://www.edwardthomson.com/blog/" target="_blank">Ed Thomson</a> was the lead developer for the offline work and he has some <a href="http://www.edwardthomson.com/blog/2008/07/teamprise_31.html" target="_blank">more details on his blog</a>.</p>  <h4>TFS 2008 SP1 New Feature Support</h4>  <p>Service Pack 1 of Team Foundation Server 2008 is hopefully due out soon, and with it come <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/archive/2008/04/28/team-foundation-server-2008-sp1.aspx" target="_blank">lots of lovely new features</a>. We took advantage in the timing of our 3.1 release to update Teamprise to support some of the new server capabilities so that they are available to our customers as soon as TFS 2008 SP1 arrives.&#160; These include:</p>  <ul>   <li>Last check-in date/time column (<a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/teamprise/000436.html" target="_blank">see my previous post about this feature</a>) </li>    <li>Support for work item meta-data filtering option (note that this option is already being used on some of the CodePlex servers so if you use Teamprise to talk to the work item functionality in CodePlex then you probably want to upgrade to Teamprise 3.1, <a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/teamprise/000339.html" target="_blank">after all the price is right</a> :-) ).</li>    <li><code>tf branch -checkin</code> command, the fastest way to create large branches and perform the check-in at the same time. </li> </ul>  <h4>Command Line Client Improvements</h4>  <p>In this release we are making publicly available a bunch of improvement and new features that we added to our command line client after some great feedback from one particular customer who has un-questionably the largest and most demanding Team Foundation Server install base on the planet. In particular we have added the &quot;-format:xml&quot; option for most commands in addition to the usual -format:brief and -format:detailed.&#160; The -format:xml option will output data from the command line client in a format easily XML parseable without truncating output which makes it much easier to use and parse command line output in scripting scenarios.&#160; However, there have been many more improvements so check out the <a href="http://download-us.teamprise.com/cs/3.1.0.8392R/release-notes/release-notes.html" target="_blank">release notes</a> for more information.</p>  <p><img height="195" alt="Look Ma, no asterisk" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/Teamprise3.1isnowavailable_C053/te64bit_2fb716f9-a6d9-4d6b-8bf9-3e08825e3fc6.png" width="240" align="right" /></p>  <h4>64-bit support on Windows.</h4>  <p>Not really worth calling out separately only to say that Teamprise is now <strong>the world's first commercially available x64 TFS client for Windows</strong> :-) </p>  <p>While we are a Java application, <a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/java/000223.html" target="_blank">as mentioned before</a>, we have a bit of JNI code to do the stuff not possible from all the JRE versions that we support (such as native authentication on Windows or making a file writable).&#160; Also we use SWT to give us a native look and feel on all platforms and SWT works by using lots of JNI to do the presentation calls.&#160; This meant that if you tried to run Teamprise under a x64 Java runtime we died pretty quickly.&#160; We've had x64 support available for other platforms for a while (including Linux), but with Windows x64 support coming in Eclipse 3.4 we took the opportunity to compile our JNI code over to the Win32 x64 architecture and it works great.</p>  <p>On a personal note, during this activity I had to fix some bits in the core Eclipse 3.4 codebase (specifically PDE for people that are interested) and the small patches that I submitted have been applied into the main Eclipse project which is a nice feeling. Eclipse is a poster-child of open source projects and it is with some pride that I can tell people I have contributed code into it. It's also nice that as Teamprise is a commercial company that uses a lot of the Eclipse code and is an Eclipse Foundation member, we are able to do our bit and contribute something back for the benefit of all.</p>  <p>As you can see, we've been busy. We've hopefully cleared some adoption blockers for some of our customers, done quite a few bug fixes and performance improvements and thrown in some new features along the way.&#160; While the headline grabbing features of interest to most people are probably the offline support and the 64-bit support, I'm very proud of this as a solid &quot;point&quot; release and I would encourage everyone with a valid 3.0 license to upgrade.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>Over the years, I have tried many different approaches to software estimation.&#160; From the Ceiling and Weller method (look up to the ceiling, scratch your chin and say &quot;Well-errr&quot;), FITA analysis (Finger In The Air) through various variations (both formal and informal) of metric based estimation techniques to things like IFPUG etc.</p>  <p>Today, I had something happen that reminded me why software estimation is so hard. I've just wasted about 8 hours trying to figure out an issue with what I thought was some bizarre firewall problem with Windows Vista SP1 x64 when it turns out that some code that <strong>I wrote</strong> was actually working correctly and was picking up a HTTP proxy preference that was pointing to a server that no longer exists.&#160; I'd just forgotten I'd fixed this bug, and that I had the proxy set in my preferences.</p>  <p>I took two lessons from this frustrating day.</p>  <ol>   <li>We need a better error message when your proxy is no-longer available</li>    <li>Software estimation is hard</li> </ol>  <p>In discussions with my wife she frequently struggles when some nights I finish work complaining that I am 3 days behind and the very next afternoon I can be caught up or even a little ahead.</p>  <p>The best way I have come up with to explain this, is to get her to imagine that I had given her 60 Suduko puzzles all rated as 10 minute puzzles.&#160; Should take you 10 hours right?&#160; Now see how long it takes you to do each puzzle.</p>  <p><img height="179" alt="suduko_times" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/WhySoftwareEstimationisHard_AF0D/suduko_times_3ca44dd6-d380-4653-a689-afb17ff4e34f.gif" width="298" align="right" /> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suduko" target="_blank">Suduko</a> is the closest analogy to computer programming that I can find for &quot;normals&quot; - i.e. people that don't code.&#160; This only really works if the person does Suduko puzzles, but my wife does so it works in our house.&#160; Suduko is a numeric analytical problem solving activity.&#160; While there are tricks and techniques to solving some puzzles, there is a significant challenge and difference to each one. Looking at the puzzle, it is hard to know if it is going to be hard or easy.&#160; You can get stuck down blind alleys and have to start all over. Also when you &quot;get into the zone&quot; you can often make surprising intuitive leaps that often defy verbal explanation afterwards. Finally, solving a hard Suduko puzzle quickly involves a fair degree of luck and depends on your state of mind at the time of trying the puzzle.&#160; There is a great amount of satisfaction to be gained from solving a Suduko puzzle along with a high degree of frustration when you cannot solve one - you know that it must be possible after all.</p>  <p>So.&#160; Each task (solving a Suduko puzzle) should take about 10 minutes, with-in a certain error range.&#160; In software estimation a really good developer doing a well known and well defined task can only hope to get their estimate to around 25% accuracy (a &quot;hard estimate&quot;) - and then there are always the odd random occurrences that throw you way off.</p>  <p>I've been in interviews where the candidate swears blind that they always finish a task on time.&#160; This tells me two things about that candidate:</p>  <ol>   <li>They are a liar</li>    <li>They either never estimate how long something is going to take up-front or they over-subscribe to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_Scott" target="_blank">Scotty</a> principle of estimation. (Or as Microsoft are fond of saying, under promise - over deliver)</li> </ol>  <p>Does this mean that we should give up on estimation?&#160; Of course not.&#160; Planning a project is going to be pretty hard if you have no idea of roughly when you are going to be finished, what the end result is going to do or how much it is going to cost.&#160; Not to forget that when estimating a large number of tasks you can rely on the fact that some of the work you finish early will offset the work that takes longer than expected.&#160; However, understanding the nature of software development and how it differs from, say, laying bricks, helps you be more likely to succeed.</p>  <p>The problems inherent in software estimation also help me to understand why Agile software development methodologies work.&#160; </p>  <ul>   <li>You are forced to <strong>break problems down into small bits</strong> that can be managed, tracked and measured.</li>    <li><strong>Small iterations</strong> means that you can only get so far behind.</li>    <li>You <strong>re-estimate and re-prioritise work at each iteration</strong> when a hard estimate on that task is possible (and therefore your estimates are more likely to succeed)</li>    <li><strong>You frequently listen </strong>to the person who will be<strong> using the software</strong></li>    <li>You can load your iterations so that there is always work to do of the correct priority to the customer when you have finished a task early and things of the appropriate priority that you can drop off the list when something takes longer</li> </ul>  <p>There are also many other techniques that people can adopt from Agile methodologies or just from common sense to reduce the amount of time taken when a task is taking longer than expected, such as</p>  <ul>   <li><strong>Limit distractions.</strong> You need time to concentrate on a single problem otherwise you will never finish it.</li>    <li><strong>Pair programming</strong>. Identify when a second pair of eyes is needed and quickly as for help in your team (can be hard when your team are distributed across multiple time-zones)</li>    <li><strong>Daily progress meetings</strong>. The guy that has been stuck for 24 hours on what he thinks is a firewall issue is quickly identified)</li>    <li><strong>Lack of ego</strong>.&#160; I'm the &quot;Windows guy&quot; in our company, if I say something is a firewall issue with Windows Vista SP1 x64 and a probably collision with the new Eclipse 3.4 launcher executable - then the new intern who only knows about the Mac he used at college should feel like he can ask a &quot;dumb&quot; question and say &quot;Have you checked your proxy settings after that bug you were fixing yesterday&quot;.</li> </ul>  <p>Anyway.&#160; All common sense stuff and writing this post has been a nice way to get rid of the frustration of finding why I was stupidly stuck for the past day.&#160; Now to stop distracting myself further and get on with some more work :-)</p>]]></description>

Of the 220-member team, approximately 150 are development engineers or quality engineers. Although the team does some programming using the Microsoft® .NET Framework, the group primarily develops in Java on computers that run a variety of operating systems, including Linux, Linux 64, UNIX, Macintosh, and Windows®. About 90 percent of the programmers in Online Services work in Eclipse or Rational Application Developer (RAD), and up to 50 percent of the testers work in Eclipse. All of the team’s build computers run UNIX or Linux."</p></blockquote> <p>Anyway, thanks to Mac and the people at Thomson Reuters for agreeing to share their experiences.&nbsp; Hopefully other organizations considering Team Foundation Server to manage the whole software development process will find the case study interesting.</p> <p>To read the case study in full, see <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/casestudies/casestudy.aspx?casestudyid=4000002078" target="_blank">Microsoft Case Studies: Thomson Reuters Unify Development Processes with Team Foundation Server and Teamprise</a>.&nbsp; I've also got a <a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/documents/Thomson_Reuters.pdf" target="_blank">PDF version available here</a>.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>I've been doing a lot of work with the Team Foundation Server 2008 SP1 Preview, and even recorded a <a href="http://www.radiotfs.com/2008/06/03/RadioTFS06TeamFoundationServer2008SP1.aspx" target="_blank">podcast about it</a> (also see <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/default.aspx" target="_blank">Brian Harry's</a> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/archive/2008/04/28/team-foundation-server-2008-sp1.aspx" target="_blank">blog post for more details on TFS 2008 SP1 features</a>).</p>  <p>One out of the many new features introduced in TFS 2008 SP1 is the &quot;Last Check-in&quot; column in the source control explorer. It is a handy little thing that I think a lot of people will find useful.&#160; </p>  <p><img style="float: none; margin-left: 25px" height="146" alt="Last Check-in Date Column in Visual Studio Source Control Explorer" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/LastCheckinDateExplained_D760/last_check_in_small_9c8299e2-3d57-4e69-8818-376287f412a5.gif" width="400" /></p>  <p>However just a couple of warnings for you for behaviour that you might not expect at first.</p>  <ol>   <li>The date shown for folders is the date that the folder was added, <strong>not</strong> the last date that any contents of that folder where checked in.&#160; That means you cannot use it to drill down onto the most recently changes files - to find that out you should still do a &quot;View History&quot; on the parent folder and look at the changesets. </li>    <li>If you are using a Visual Studio 2008 SP1 client (or Teamprise 3.1 for that matter when it is released) and you point it at a server prior to TFS 2008 SP1 (i.e. TFS 2005 or the RTM release of TFS 2008) then you do not get any data in this column because the server doesn't send back that data to the client. </li> </ol>  <p>Otherwise it works pretty much as you expect.&#160; Most useful is that you can obviously sort the column to find the recently changed files in a big list of files.</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>I'm always keen try new and novel ways to keep in touch with the status of my software projects.&#160; Fortunately, Team Foundation Server provides many ways to do this.&#160; While the <a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/vsts/000395.html">Build Wallboard</a> is fun if you have a spare monitor and machine lying around, I wanted to experiment with some inexpensive dedicated devices, and so Brian the Build Bunny was born. </p>  <div class="wlWriterSmartContent" id="scid:5737277B-5D6D-4f48-ABFC-DD9C333F4C5D:2e205f46-9fcf-4ee7-95e9-871f98b30965" style="padding-right: 0px; display: inline; padding-left: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; padding-top: 0px"><div id="2b3a974d-99ed-4fc5-a671-1312a3e59499" style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px; display: inline;"><div><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is32fWJJA-I&amp;hl=en" target="_new"><img src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/413058e9f27a_134BB/video626a89d530c0.jpg" galleryimg="no" onload="var downlevelDiv = document.getElementById('2b3a974d-99ed-4fc5-a671-1312a3e59499'); downlevelDiv.innerHTML = &quot;&lt;div&gt;&lt;object width=\&quot;425\&quot; height=\&quot;355\&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=\&quot;movie\&quot; value=\&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/Is32fWJJA-I&amp;hl=en\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/param&gt;&lt;param name=\&quot;wmode\&quot; value=\&quot;transparent\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/param&gt;&lt;embed src=\&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/Is32fWJJA-I&amp;hl=en\&quot; type=\&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash\&quot; wmode=\&quot;transparent\&quot; width=\&quot;425\&quot; height=\&quot;355\&quot;&gt;&lt;\/embed&gt;&lt;\/object&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;&quot;;" alt=""></a></div></div></div>  <p>Brian is a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Violet-Nabaztagtag-WiFi-Rabbit/dp/B000OFHBKS/woodwardwebcom">Nabaztag smart rabbit</a>.&#160; He reads out details of check-ins and builds.&#160; If a build has failed then his ears go down to show how sad he feels, but if you fix the build his ears will soon pick up again.</p>  <p>I've had Brian for about a year now waiting to do this project, but when I tried it in the past I always found the response times from the rabbit to be too slow.&#160; However earlier this year, the Nabaztag developers updated the code running the rabbits so that they are now using the XMPP (Jabber) protocol to receive updates and the service now seems pretty good.</p>  <p>Brian is now sitting on my desk chattering away and letting me know what is happening in TFS.&#160; If you want to find out more about how he works and see him in action then take a look at the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Is32fWJJA-I">video</a>. If your company blocks YouTube but you have Silverlight installed then you can view <a href="http://silverlight.services.live.com/invoke/15051/buildbunny/iframe.html" target="_blank">a higher quality version of the video courtesy of the Windows Live Streaming service</a>.&#160; I'll go through the code behind Brian in a later post if there is any interest, but it is pretty much a standard TFS event listener that then sends text to the rabbit using the <a href="http://api.nabaztag.com/docs/home.html">Nabaztag API</a>.</p>]]></description>

<title>What&apos;s Your Pocket Knife Language?</title>
<link>http://www.woodwardweb.com/personal/000431.html</link>
<description><![CDATA[<p><img height="195" alt="Pocket Knife Language" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/images/pocket_knife.jpg" width="200" align="right" />As a professional programmer, the languages I code in during the day are very much dependant on the particular project I am working on.&#160; Also as a programmer I have a very low threshold for repetitive or complex tasks - basically if I have to do something more than twice then I'll probably write a quick program to do it for me (sometimes taking longer than the repetitive task would have done, but I have a lot more fun along the way :-) ).&#160; These little programs are throwaway pieces of code.&#160; I'll probably never run them more than once - I'll almost certainly never come back to them and I'm certain that no-one else will see them.</p>  <p>I find it interesting what language people choose to write these little disposal programs with - I call it your &quot;Pocket Knife Language&quot;.&#160; Currently I would usually use C#, despite that fact that I code all day in Java.&#160; I would normally use C# just because it is that much easier to access the bits of the operating system I normally run on (Windows) - but there are a huge number of libraries and methods in the .NET framework to do the heavy lifting for me.&#160; Jumping between C# and Java is pretty easy for my brain to cope with.</p>  <p>But It's not always been like this for me.&#160; I guess my first pocket knife language was probably Excel and then I quickly moved on to Visual Basic.&#160; I stayed with VB for a while. At the time I was earning a living writing mainframe code - anything that requires you to write a 30 line program (in JCL) to just compile and run your code is not suitable for inclusion in anyone's coding pocket knife :-)&#160; In my professional career I then moved into web development, it was around this time that Java started to appear on the scene and I moved into J2EE work and at some point, I'm not quite sure when, I started using Java as my pocket knife language.&#160; I went through a brief spell when I was doing a lot of front end web development that I dispensed with IDE's and compilers completely and JavaScript and the DOM actually became my pocket knife of first choice.&#160; However I quickly saw the light.&#160; Once I started working on .NET projects professionally it didn't take me long to move to C# as my pocket knife language and it has stuck there for a few years now despite moving back to Java on the professional front.</p>  <p>I was having a chat at the weekend with a friend of mine who is currently doing some very clever and complex work down at a pretty low level which requires him to be coding in C++ all day long - however I found it interesting that he was using Java as his pocket knife language.&#160; Other people I work with would use Perl or Python as theirs.</p>  <p>So, dear reader, what is your pocket knife language and why?</p>]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[<p>I am currently playing with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/archive/2008/05/13/vs-vsts-tfs-2008-sp1-beta-is-now-available.aspx">SP1 of VSTS 2008 and TFS 2008</a> in a Windows Server 2008 VMWare instance I have.&#160;&#160; Whenever I created this particular instance I kept the disk space at 16Gb which is normally plenty for these play instances but after installing the service pack of VSTS my disk space was getting low.</p>  <p>I thought I would try extending the size of my virtual disk and it was suprising easy.</p>  <ol>   <li>First, I had to take a fill clone my image to remove the snapshot history. </li>    <li>The on the new clone's disk I executed the following command:      <br />      <pre>&quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\VMware\VMware Workstation\vmware-vdiskmanager.exe&quot; -x 32Gb win2008-000004-cl1.vmdk</pre>
  </li>

<p>  <li>This extended the disk size, now I need to extend the size of the partition.&#160; Boot up the virtual Windows 2008 server, right click on &quot;My Computer&quot; and select &quot;Manage&quot;.&#160; Go To Storage, Disk Management and then right click on the C: partition and select Extend to extend the partition the the size of the remaining disk.</li><br />
</ol></p>

<p>Tada.&#160; No third party tools (like Partition Magic etc) needed.</p>]]></description>
