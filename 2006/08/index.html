            <p>Recently, I've had a surge of emails asking various questions about Team Foundation Server and how to do certain things.&nbsp; While I always (eventually) respond, it can sometimes take me a while.&nbsp; If you have questions about Team Foundation Server then the best place to go is the <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/default.aspx?ForumGroupID=5&amp;SiteID=1">MSDN forums</a>.&nbsp; These forums are monitored by the VSTS team as well as by the Team System MVP's and other folks who know stuff about the product.&nbsp; Unlike a lot of&nbsp;newsgroups, these forums are actually a very welcoming and friendly place to ask questions.&nbsp; I personally hang out on the following forums:-</p> <ul> <li><b><a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=22&amp;SiteID=1">Team Foundation Server - General</a></b>  <li><b><a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=68&amp;SiteID=1">Team Foundation Server - Setup</a></b>  <li><b><a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=478&amp;SiteID=1">Team Foundation Server - Version Control</a></b>  <li><b><a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=479&amp;SiteID=1">Team Foundation Server - Work Item Tracking</a></b>  <li><b><a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=477&amp;SiteID=1">Team Foundation Server - Administration</a></b>  <li><b><a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=481&amp;SiteID=1">Team Foundation Server - Build Automation</a></b>  <li><b><a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=482&amp;SiteID=1">Team Foundation Server - Process Templates</a></b>  <li><b><a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=480&amp;SiteID=1">Team Foundation Server - Reporting</a></b>  <li><b><a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=20&amp;SiteID=1">Visual Studio Team System - General</a></b>  <li><b><a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=18&amp;SiteID=1">Visual Studio Team System - Developers</a></b></li></ul> <p>As well as the official <a href="http://forums.microsoft.com/MSDN/default.aspx?ForumGroupID=5&amp;SiteID=1">MSDN forums</a>, you can also try one of the community ones.&nbsp; These don't tend to get the traffic from Team folks but are still good resources.&nbsp; It's also a good place to ask questions that you might not want to ask on a Microsoft resource (such as how does TFS stack up against Product B) and get an answer from somebody who is not paid by Microsoft.</p> <ul> <li><a href="http://teamsystemrocks.com/forums/default.aspx">Team System Rocks</a> (excellent community resource site)  <li><a href="http://teamfoundationserver.org/Web/forums/default.aspx">TeamFoundationServer.org</a>&nbsp;(a new UK based resource)</li></ul> <p>At <a href="http://www.teamprise.com/">Teamprise</a> we also have our own <a href="http://support.teamprise.com">forum</a> and <a href="http://kb.teamprise.com">knowledge base</a> that are worth checking out if the question is related to use of Team Foundation Server from Java or on the Unix / Mac / Linux platforms.</p> <p>Before you ask the question, it is probably worth checking the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms181232.aspx">MSDN documentation</a> first or using your <a href="http://www.google.com/">favorite search engine</a>, but don't worry about asking if you can't find your answer - the folks on these forums are always happy to point you to the best resource.</p> <p>You never know, if you ask a question on these forums then you might still get me answering it if you are unlucky enough.&nbsp; By asking the question in a public forum you are doing a service for the next person that comes down the line with the same problem as they'll be able to see somebody else with the same issue and (hopefully) the answer.</p>

            <p>Showing branch history in a visual way&nbsp;is not something that the current version 1.0 of the Microsoft Team Foundation Server client is great at.&nbsp; In fairness to the team, showing the branch history of files in an&nbsp;graphical way is pretty&nbsp;complicated and would involve many lines of code&nbsp;&ndash; especially when you build a version control system as flexible and powerful as Team Foundation Server.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been around the business for a good few years now, and before I joined a software company specialising in Version Control tools I had only used branching twice<a href="#only_twice">*</a>.&nbsp; This suggests that branching is not something that everyone uses all the time&nbsp; &ndash; and those that do don&rsquo;t often need to see the branch history.&nbsp; Therefore the VSTS team not spending an awful lot of time on a branch visualisation tool that will only get used&nbsp;less than&nbsp;1%&nbsp; of requests seems like a pragmatic approach to me (especially if the data is available &ndash; just not in the easiest way&nbsp;to understand)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Team Foundation Server in production project every working day&nbsp;for over a year now, today was the first day I needed the server to tell me the&nbsp;branch history for a file.&nbsp; So, until we get branch visualisation in the tool&nbsp;or from the open source project <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=TFSVTreeBrowse">Vertigo</a>&nbsp;we are stuck with the Branches tab when you select a file in source control and select Properties&hellip;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/blog/branches_tab.png"><img style="FLOAT: none; MARGIN-LEFT: 25px" alt="Branches Tab" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/blog/branches_tab_thumb.jpg" border="0" /></a><a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/blog/branches.png"></a></p>
<p>I sat and stared at the branches tab for about 10 minutes before I could work out what it was telling me.&nbsp; The &ldquo;F1&rdquo; help is ok here in that it introduces the concepts of branching.&nbsp; However, I know what branching&nbsp;is &ndash;&nbsp;I was trying to understand the dialog&hellip;</p>
<p>To help understand, I drew a quick diagram on a bit of paper.&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of the blog post I fired up&nbsp;Powerpoint 2007 Beta 2 to give you a&nbsp;prettier looking one:-</p>
<p><a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/blog/branch_diagram.png"><img style="FLOAT: none; MARGIN-LEFT: 25px" alt="Branch Diagram" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/blog/branch_diagram_thumb.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Basically.&nbsp; The item in bold in the dialog is the item that you selected on for Properties.&nbsp; This particular example shows that the file itself was a branch of version 2750 of&nbsp;myProject/testFile.txt and has been subsequently branched as myproject-branch3/testFile2&ndash;branch.txt.&nbsp; Easily really.&nbsp; This means that if you were putting a patch into the file, you might want to consider patching the file it was branched from &ndash; but also all the other files that have been derived from that branch.</p>
<p>As you can see, it would also be a lot easier to understand if you used a <a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/vsts/000224.html">sensible naming structure</a> when branching files.&nbsp; However &ndash; the information you need is given to you, even if you have to concentrate for a while..</p>
<p><a name="only_twice">*</a> If the statement that I only branched twice surprises you then here is an explanation.&nbsp; While I understood the concepts &ndash; it was still always a little scary but more importantly when you start branching your source code the whole team has to have the discipline to make sure changes are merged back into the appropriate branches etc.&nbsp; In&nbsp;a lot of&nbsp;internal IT projects, there is only the need for one main line of development and that line is best managed using continuous integration techniques to ensure it is always in a fit state.&nbsp; To be fair, in&nbsp;a lot of those internal IT projects, you would probably get benefit from branching at times &ndash; but the pain of managing those branches would outweigh many of the benefits &ndash; especially in you work in a place where you are struggling to just make people check their code compiles before committing it to version control &ndash; never mind making sure they have applied that fix in a sensible way to the appropriate branches&hellip;</p>
<p>Now I work for an ISV, branching is vital.&nbsp; In our main line of code we have been working on the next version (version 2.0) since we stopped developing version 1 back in March of this year.&nbsp; Originally, work on NTLM authentication was slated to be a V2.0 feature but when it was completed earlier than we thought we wanted to make it available to our V1 customers but not include all the unfinished (and buggy) stuff in the main development line.&nbsp; When we released Version 1, we branched the code (from $/Teamprise/trunk to $/Teamprise/releases/1.0).&nbsp; This meant the new NTLM authentication logic could be merged into the V1.0 branch and a new release V1.1 be issued.&nbsp; This is just one example where branching is essential &ndash; but you can use branching for many other reasons (such as allowing greater parallel development etc).</p>
<p>Like all tools at your disposal as a developer, you have to learn what it is good at and what the downsides are, then apply&nbsp;the technique&nbsp;appropriately.</p>

            <p>I use <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMWare</a> a lot.&nbsp; As we work on a cross-platform client to Team Foundation Server, I not only need to test our client on many operating systems, I also run Team Foundation Server in VMWare to talk to test our client against.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.teamprise.com/">Teamprise</a><a href="http://www.teamprise.com/"> </a>Explorer and the Eclipse plug-in use SWT for the UI Layer.&nbsp; This means that not only is performance great &ndash; the client takes on the native look and feel of the host operating system.&nbsp; However, you do need to test dialogs on those operating systems to make sure they all look ok and size correctly.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I was&nbsp;so busy looking over the Specs of the new <a href="http://www.apple.com/macpro/">Mac Pro</a> that I&nbsp;nearly missed the <a href="http://www.vmware.com/news/releases/mac.html">announcement</a> from VMWare that their Mac-Intel version is on its way.&nbsp; This means that we can get another one of those shiny <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">Mac Book Pro</a>&rsquo;s and do a totally stand-alone demonstration of <a href="http://www.teamprise.com/">Teamprise</a> talking to a (virtual) Team Foundation Server from Mac, Windows XP, Solaris and Linux all from one laptop.&nbsp; It will also be a boon for testing as nearly a third of the <a href="http://www.teamprise.com/">Teamprise</a> development team work on Macs (both Intel based and PowerPC based&nbsp;G5&rsquo;s)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.parallels.com/">Parallels</a> has offered similar functionality on the Mac-Intel platform for a while, however now that VMWare are going to be offering virtualization on the Mac-Intel platform it means that we can re-use our library of VMWare formated virtual PC&rsquo;s &ndash; which will save a lot of setup time.&nbsp; VMWare are one of those companies that don&rsquo;t announce things publicly until they are well down the line and pretty solid, so I am hopeful that the beta will be available soon.&nbsp; If you are interested, you can pre-register for the beta <a href="http://vmware.rsc02.net/servlet/campaignrespondent?_ID_=vmwi.1756">here</a>.&nbsp; Interestingly (and probably not that surprisingly) Microsoft have <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/mac/0,39020393,39280596,00.htm">announced</a> that they are shelving Virtual PC for the Mac and won&rsquo;t be unleashing Mac-Intel support on to the public.</p>

            <p>I know it only seems like a few moments have past since we <a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/vsts/000261.html">released</a> version 1.1 onto the unsuspecting public, but today we opened the doors a little on Version 2.0 as we start our <a href="http://www.teamprise.com/preview/preview-register.py">2.0 Preview Program</a>.&nbsp; The word &ldquo;preview&rdquo; is deliberately chosen &ndash; this is to allow you to take a peek at the current state of development on our 2.0 branch, take some of the many new features out for a bit of a drive and kick the tires around.&nbsp; If you think it&rsquo;ll be something you&rsquo;d like to&nbsp;use when it&rsquo;s finished then <a href="http://support.teamprise.com/viewforum.php?f=6">let us know</a> &ndash; equally please <a href="http://support.teamprise.com/viewforum.php?f=6">let us know</a> what you really don&rsquo;t like, what you would really want&nbsp;or what just blatantly doesn&rsquo;t work in your environment.&nbsp; There are bugs in this release, so I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend you use this in production &ndash; our&nbsp;<a href="http://www.teamprise.com/download/">current V1.1 release</a> is the most stable one and you should use that if you plan to be using <a href="http://www.teamprise.com/">Teamprise</a> in anger.&nbsp; Additionally, if you purchase V1.1 right now then you get a free upgrade to V2.0 when it is released later in the year.</p>
<p>Version 1 was all about making a robust implementation of the version control functionality in Java and then integrating this with Eclipse.&nbsp; Version 2 is about expanding on that robust version control mechanism to bring in many of the additional&nbsp;features offered by Team Foundation Server.&nbsp; While we have not finished implementing all the features we plan to put into&nbsp;2.0 yet, many of them are there.&nbsp; Some major and some subtle.&nbsp; Now that Version 2.0 is available for preview customers I just wanted to highlight some of my favourite additions.</p>
<h3>Team Explorer</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/blog/teamexplorer.png"><img style="FLOAT: none; MARGIN-LEFT: 25px" alt="The all new Team Explorer inside Eclipse." src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/blog/teamexplorer.png" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We now have a &ldquo;Team Explorer&rdquo; view.&nbsp; Looks awfully like the Visual Studio one I&rsquo;m sure you can see.&nbsp; You can now access your work items, Sharepoint document libraries and reports from <a href="http://www.teamprise.com/">Teamprise</a>.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s that you say, &ldquo;Work Items&rdquo;?</p>
<h3>Work Item Support</h3>
<p><img style="FLOAT: none; MARGIN-LEFT: 25px" alt="Edit TFS Work Items inside Eclipse" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/blog/work_item_editing.png" border="0" /></p>
<p>Yup.&nbsp; Full work item editing support, from the comfort of a rich client interface on a non-windows OS or from Eclipse on Windows if you fancy.&nbsp; Other than Java (and Eclipse if you are using our IDE plug-in), nothing else is needed, just install our client onto your machine and point it at your Team Foundation Server and you are away.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The depth of functionality here is huge &ndash; basically because we are parsing the same work item definitions that you access from Visual Studio.&nbsp; All customised work items should also work (if they work in Visual Studio Team System).&nbsp; If yours don&rsquo;t then <a href="http://support.teamprise.com/viewforum.php?f=6">let us know</a>.&nbsp; If you want to <a href="javascript:var dom='%77%6F%6F%64%77%61%72%64%77%65%62%2E%63%6F%6D',e2='mailto' + ': ', ad='%62%6C%6F%67%2E%63%6F%6D%6D%65%6E%74';var e0=e2+ad+'%40'+dom+'?Subject=Process%20Template: ';(window.location?window.location.replace(e0):document.write(e0));">email me</a> a copy of your process template I&rsquo;ll add it to one of our test servers and we&rsquo;ll test against it during internal development &ndash; I am keen on getting as many examples of real life work item types as possible to make sure we have everything done right.</p>
<p>The work item editing support rocks, I often have to double check if I am in Eclipse or Visual Studio.&nbsp; Even the fonts used on Windows are the same &ndash; it&rsquo;s crazily good (probably because I had very little to do with this feature).&nbsp; One of the few differences is that, because we use the latest version of SWT in <a href="http://www.teamprise.com/">Teamprise</a> Explorer, our tabs are displayed with the proper native look and feel (i.e. a gradient fill if you have Windows XP or the Royale theme installed) &ndash; <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/cs/miscctrl/themedtabpage.asp">try doing that in .NET</a> :-)&nbsp; However, there are a couple of other little extras you get that I want to show off.</p>
<h3>Work Item Searching</h3>
<p>Right click on a the Work Items node of a Team Project and look what options are currently available&hellip;</p>
<p><img style="FLOAT: none; MARGIN-LEFT: 25px" alt="Context menu for Work Items" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/blog/work_item_context_menu.png" border="0" /></p>
<p>Before you rush to click on the search icon, take a little time to admire it.&nbsp; That little&nbsp;collection of 256 pixels was probably my only contribution to the whole Work Item project !&nbsp; Anyway, don&rsquo;t admire it for too long or you won&rsquo;t get to the next Dialog&hellip;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/blog/work_item_search.png"><img style="FLOAT: none; MARGIN-LEFT: 25px" alt="Work_item_search" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/blog/work_item_search_thumb.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>This can only be described as a <em>power search</em> feature.&nbsp; You want to find a bug, but the only thing you can remember about it was that it had something to do with &ldquo;cheese&rdquo; &ndash; no problem.&nbsp; There are many more useful features available here to help narrow down your search.</p>
<p>Enough of work items.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s talk about some of the stuff I did have a little to do with.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Teamprise&nbsp;Explorer 2.0</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/blog/explorer_on_windows.png"><img style="FLOAT: none; MARGIN-LEFT: 25px" alt="Teamprise Explorer on Windows" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/blog/explorer_on_windows_thumb1.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>We have revised the look and feel of the stand-alone TFS client, <a href="http://www.teamprise.com/">Teamprise</a> Explorer, to bring in the Team Explorer view and work item support.&nbsp; Ok, it looks nice on my Royale themed copy of Windows XP &ndash; but what about that shiny MacBook Pro you just sold your house to buy?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/blog/explorer_on_mac.png"><img style="FLOAT: none; MARGIN-LEFT: 25px" alt="Teamprise Explorer on Mac" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/blog/explorer_on_mac_thumb1.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>Probably worth pointing out here that since version 1.1 we have been a Universal Binary on the Mac Platform (i.e. we run on both the Intel and PowerPC based models).&nbsp; Obviously, <a href="http://www.teamprise.com/">Teamprise</a> Explorer also runs from Linux, Solaris etc.</p>
<h3>Shelving Support</h3>
<p><img style="FLOAT: none; MARGIN-LEFT: 25px" alt="Shelving Support in Eclipse" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/blog/shelving_support.png" border="0" /></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s currently a little hidden away, but there are some new menu options on the Pending Changes view so that you can Shelve and Un-shelve your pending changes.&nbsp; We have a couple of performance problems that show up particularly when you do a branch operation over a large set of files so current branch, merge and label are not enabled in this preview release.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m working on that right now so that we can include those remaining source control operations before we ship V2.0 later this year.</p>
<h3>Get Latest on Checkout</h3>
<p>OK, it has to been one of the most requested features we get &ndash; especially with users who have come from Source Safe.&nbsp; They just expect a check-out to bring down the latest version &ndash; <a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/vsts/000179.html">but this is not how TFS works</a>.&nbsp; If you are one of those people that get really annoyed by this, then we now have an option that is disabled by default but you can go switch it on if you want (Preferences&hellip;, Teamprise, Source Control).</p>
<p><img style="FLOAT: none; MARGIN-LEFT: 25px" alt="Checkout != Get Latest - unless you switch on this option." src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/blog/Get_Latest_On_Checkout.png" border="0" /></p>
<h3>Additional Command Line Client Capabilities</h3>
<p>A little hard to show in a screen-shot, but we have made some major improvements to the command line client.&nbsp; To begin with, you only need to download one version of the command line client and it will run on your Java enabled system (including FreeBSD if that is your fancy).&nbsp; Not only do we have the good old &ldquo;tf&rdquo; style commands, we introduced a new command &ldquo;wit&rdquo;.&nbsp; This allows you to do work item operations from the command line including viewing queries, view work items and editing fields on a work item.&nbsp; While this is handy if you are stuck on a Solaris box with only a text prompt to talk to &ndash; it will also come in handy in&nbsp;a ton of automation and scripting based scenarios that we can think of.</p>
<p>That is a quick rundown of some of the stuff I am most excited about in this preview release.&nbsp; There are a ton of new features, performance improvements and bug fixes for some bizarre edges cases that I hope you never happen to come across.&nbsp; Over the next few weeks we&rsquo;ll be doing more of the same, but I wanted to show you some of the cool stuff we&rsquo;ve been working on.&nbsp; Please drop by the <a href="http://support.teamprise.com/">forums</a> and let us know what you think.</p>
