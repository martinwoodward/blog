            <p>By the time I post this, you'll probably see it posted a hundred places, however on the rare chance that you only read my blog and not one of the many other great blogs about team system, can I point you to the upcoming Team System chat.&nbsp; The reason why these get so widely blogged about is not because we get asked to (well, it might have a little&nbsp;to do with that) - but actually because these chats are actually really worthwhile attending.&nbsp; You get the opportunity to talk with loads of people from the product groups, from the decision makers who sign the cheques on which features get worked on, through to the actual guys and gals who do the actual work on those features.&nbsp; You also get to ask questions about how something you use today&nbsp;works and get the answer, in real-time, from the person that wrote it (or at least, someone who knows that person).&nbsp; It is a great opportunity to influence the team as well as get your questions answered.</p> <p><b>Come chat with the Team System product team – July 3rd</b>  <p>Join members of the Visual Studio Team System product group to discuss features available in Visual Studio Team Foundation Server, Team Editions for Architects, Developers, Database Pros, and Testers. In addition, discuss what's new in the upcoming Orcas CTP.  <p>As it proved so successful last time, they will&nbsp;be holding two sessions to try and catch as many folks around the globe as possible: <p>Join the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/chats">chat</a> on Tuesday, July 3<sup>rd</sup> , 2007 from 10:00am - 11:00am Pacific Time. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/communities/chats/vcs/07_0703_MSDN_VSTS2.ics">Add to Calendar</a> | <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?year=2007&amp;month=07&amp;day=03&amp;hour=10&amp;min=0&amp;sec=0&amp;p1=234">Additional Time Zones</a>  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -or-  <p>Join the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/chats">chat</a> on Tuesday, July 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2007 from 4:00pm - 5:00pm Pacific Time. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/communities/chats/vcs/07_0703_MSDN_VSTS.ics">Add to Calendar</a> | <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?year=2007&amp;month=07&amp;day=03&amp;hour=16&amp;min=0&amp;sec=0&amp;p1=234">Additional Time Zones</a></p>

Obviously the traffic was pretty bad, but better than I expected.&nbsp; We arrived just after 7pm and found a perfect spot on the beach in fantastic weather.&nbsp; The sight and sounds of the actual launch were incredible, especially the belly rumbling thunder of the sonic boom and the cheers of joy from all the people massed onto the beach.&nbsp; The most unexpected thing was the cloud left by the launch trail - a truly beautiful sight.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.flickr.com/gp/58045305@N00/15SA37">Photo's of the launch are up on Flikr</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/v/DG015R-ee_k">video available on YouTube</a>.</p>

            <p>I don't travel as much as I used to, but there are some things about a hotel that caters to business travelers that they should get right.&nbsp; Forget about your fancy shmancy decor and strange&nbsp;taps that take you 5 minutes to figure out how to&nbsp;turn on, I'm talking basics here.&nbsp; Here is my list of things that a hotel should get right:-</p> <ol> <li><strong>Internet access that does not suck</strong>, and is free.&nbsp; You'd think that paying $12.95 per day would give you a decent internet connection wouldn't you - well apparently not. <li><strong>An iron and ironing board&nbsp;in your room</strong>.&nbsp; If I've traveled halfway across the world, then the odds are that my shirts are going to need a little bit of a press in the morning.&nbsp; I do not want to have to call down to housekeeping for an iron and ironing board to take 30 minutes to arrive when I am already late.&nbsp; I have a funny anecdote about ironing shirts in hotels that I'll share with you sometime - feel free to ask me about it if you see me.  <li><strong>A good shower</strong>.&nbsp; One that you has a gradual range of settings from hot to cold, trickle all the way up to water cannon.&nbsp; Pressure and temperature controls should not be binary in operation.  <li><strong>An alarm clock</strong>.&nbsp;When I wake up in the middle of the night with jetlag, it would be great to be able to look up at a clock to tell the time without switching a light on. <li><strong>Air conditioning</strong>.&nbsp; Any air conditioning system that is used should not sound like a 777 taking off. <li><strong>A light switch by the door.</strong>&nbsp; This seems to be something that American hotels have trouble with in particular.&nbsp; I'd light to flick a switch by the door that switches a majority of the lights on.&nbsp; I don't want to go fumbling around in the dark to figure out how to switch on all the lamps individually&nbsp;- what is it with that twisty thing on American light fittings? <li><strong>Plenty of spare plug sockets</strong>.&nbsp; I want to be able to plug in my laptop and possibly charge my cell phone at the same time without having to move furniture. <li><strong>Hangers in a wardrobe</strong>.&nbsp; More than 2 hangers please.&nbsp; Real hangers are the best, but if you have to use those&nbsp;weird anti-theft&nbsp;ones then fine - but I might steal those just to make a point. <li><strong>Curtains that shut in the middle</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the&nbsp;precious few hours I get in my room I would love a bit of sleep - blocking the light out would help me a lot. <li><strong>Noise insulation</strong>.&nbsp; If the&nbsp;couple in the room next door is having a noisy argument (or worse, the couple next door are having a noisy something else) then I really don't want to hear it - especially when I've met the&nbsp;elderly and somewhat large&nbsp;couple occupying the room and so am unable to block the disturbing mental images from my mind.</li></ol> <p>Note that there is nothing fancy here.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet you frequently find hotels that consider themselves a bit more upmarket often get the basics totally wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've tried to be restrained with the nice things that actually make me smile.&nbsp; Things like big fluffy towels, proper duvets, nice decor, alarm clocks than include an iPod dock, and&nbsp;friendly&nbsp;and helpful staff - those would all be a bonus.</p> <p>Sorry for the rant - I love the work I do and I am very privileged to get to travel around talking to people about interesting stuff, I'm just tired and grumpy (possibly because my current hotel scores 2.5/10 in this list&nbsp;;-)</p>

            <p>I am currently sat in sunny Newark having sped through immigration in record time (there wasn't a single person in front of me in the queue - the first time that has ever happened. For anyone that it interested, I've fallen back into my <a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/personal/000171.html">Chicken rut</a>.&nbsp; </p> <p>Anyway, I'm on my way to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/events/teched2007/community.mspx">TechEd in Orlando</a>.&nbsp; This year I'll be working at the Team System <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/events/teched2007/learningcenter.mspx">TLC</a> (Technical Learning Center) as well as hanging around the Teamprise booth (#1333 near the massage area apparently) - do pop by and say "Hi" if you are around or at any of the various parties etc.</p> <p><strong>Update:</strong> Woot!&nbsp; I've just had an email telling me that I've been bumped to First for my Newark to Orlando segment.&nbsp; Sweet.</p>

            <p>Good news <a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/personal/000358.html#comments">World's Smallest TFS Proxy fans</a>.&nbsp; At 11:10 this morning, the friendly man from Dell appeared at my door&nbsp;with a new motherboard flown in from Holland this morning.&nbsp; With-in twenty minutes he had the motherboards swapped out and we plugged the SX270 in to hear that familiar whirr of the fans as it came back to life.</p> <p>Now, I know that Dell customer support has been getting a lot of stick lately - but I have to say that I've been left seriously impressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly 24-hours after reporting a problem with an old, out of warranty,&nbsp;machine I'd bought from their Dell Outlet store (which sells returned machines at a discount), I had a brand new motherboard and was back up an running.&nbsp; Can't ask for more than that.</p> <p>More importantly, the World's Smallest TFS Proxy Server lives again, hopefully to put in a few more years tireless service in my garage.</p>
