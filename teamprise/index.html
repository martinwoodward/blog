If you haven’t then head on over to the following site for more information (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/pathways/teamprise">http://www.microsoft.com/pathways/teamprise</a>).&#160; Basically when Microsoft shipped it’s first release, Teamprise ceased sales of the existing products and will begin the process of wrapping up the company.&#160; Microsoft will be the contact point from now on for all purchases and support enquiries.</p>  <p>Teamprise 3.0 customers are entitled to a free upgrade to the new Team Explorer Everywhere 2010 version.&#160; You can find out the full details of eligibility and how to claim this license at the following page on the pathways site (<a title="http://www.microsoft.com/pathways/teamprise/Teamprise%20v3.x.htm" href="http://www.microsoft.com/pathways/teamprise/Teamprise%20v3.x.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/pathways/teamprise/Teamprise%20v3.x.htm</a>).</p>  <p>If you are a new customer, you’ll be please to know that Team Explorer Everywhere is now also included in the Ultimate level MSDN subscription and is also available as a standalone product for folks without the top tier MSDN Subscription (or indeed without any MSDN Subscription).</p>  <p>If you have any questions of feedback about all this then the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/pathways/teamprise/">pathways site has contact details</a>.&#160; You can also discuss things over on our <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/tee/threads">MSDN Forum</a>.</p>  <p>Working on Teamprise has un-doubtably been the highlight of my career prior to joining Microsoft, and I have to confess to at having a tinge of sadness that the brand we created in our little start-up is going away.&#160; That said all the developers who worked on the product came over to Microsoft and were part of the team that got this new release under the Microsoft banner out the door.&#160; We all worked long hours to ensure that the new version was able to take advantage of many of the TFS 2010 features and I’m very proud of what we managed to accomplish since November.&#160; Also, we’re obviously not stopping there.&#160; Since shipping the initial release we’ve continued development and are hoping to keep getting more functionality out the door.&#160; In addition, now that we are part of the core Team Foundation Server team we get to influence the future direction of the product in ways that I cannot even predict at this time.&#160; The TFS team were always very good at listening to our feedback from a cross-platform point of view – but now we’re all part of the same team we’re even harder to forget :-)</p>  <p>But more on all this soon.&#160; I’ve been so busy helping get Team Explorer Everywhere 2010 shipped along-side the rest of the Visual Studio 2010 release that I’ve been neglecting my blogging and podcasting duties.&#160; But it’s great to be back!</p>

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>When the Teamprise technology was acquired by Microsoft, one of the first non-TFS 2010 feature things that we knew we needed to do was change the name.&#160; You’d think re-branding would be simple, just do a global search and replace for “Teamprise” and replace with the official Microsoft name – and then reformat everything because the Microsoft name is obviously going to be longer :-)&#160; Obviously nothing is that simple.&#160; It took a while before we decided on a name, at the moment we are <em>Microsoft Team Explorer 2010 codename “Eaglestone”</em> – which in the team we sometimes abbreviate to “TEE” (because it is shorter, but it is also handily a slight homage to the Teamprise logo which is the T power button).</p>  <p>However, in the past we used “Teamprise” to mean different things.&#160; For example we have “Teamprise” views in Eclipse.&#160; When you whent to import a project from Team Foundation Server you selected “Teamprise”.&#160; Sometimes we used Teamprise as a product name, sometimes as a metaphor for accessing TFS. Sometimes we used it under the covers as well – for example as the name of an annotation in version control when storing check-in polices or as the layout type when doing work item forms.&#160; </p>  <p><a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/WhatsinaName_9CB5/tp_montage_2.png" target="_blank"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="Montage of Teamprise screens showing branding choices" border="0" alt="Montage of Teamprise screens showing branding choices" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/WhatsinaName_9CB5/tp_montage_thumb.png" width="400" height="311" /></a> </p>  <p>This was a deliberate decision at Teamprise.&#160; When we started we were just a plucky start-up convinced that we were one of many working to put TFS into Eclipse.&#160; We wanted to make our name synonymous with accessing TFS from Eclipse so that people would think of us instead of a competitor.&#160; But we also wanted to allow competing products to exist in the same Eclipse installation so that users had choice as to which TFS connector they used and it wasn’t too confusing for them.&#160; Largely this was a success.&#160; We got a solution to market at the right time and managed to keep improving the technology and a competing product never really appeared.&#160; To people who know Team Foundation Server, Teamprise == TFS in Eclipse and Teamprise == TFS cross-platform.</p>  <p>But, there was a whole world of people that we didn’t reach.&#160; People would always need to know to ask “How do I connect to TFS from Eclipse, or How do I connect to TFS from the Mac” and be given the answer of Teamprise (either by a person or a search engine).</p>  <p>Now that we are part of the Team Foundation Server team, it doesn’t make sense to be as “visible” anymore as a brand in the UI.&#160; When you are connecting to Team Foundation Server in Eclipse or want to see Team Foundation Server resources – you should look for Team Foundation Server.&#160; When looking for how to connect to TFS from Eclipse, you should look for the product that contains a “Team Foundation Server plug-in for Eclipse”.&#160; It is now Team Foundation Server we want you to connect with (both literally, and from a branding perspective).&#160; All this means that it is more complicated than just doing a search/replace in the UI as now we need to figure out when we were using Teamprise to talk about TFS and when we were using it to talk about the software that you plug-in to Eclipse.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/WhatsinaName_9CB5/tee_montage_2.png" target="_blank"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="Montage of screens taken from the new Microsoft release" border="0" alt="Montage of screens taken from the new Microsoft release" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/WhatsinaName_9CB5/tee_montage_thumb.png" width="400" height="290" /></a> </p>  <p>And then there was package renaming.&#160; All of our code used to be in com.teamprise packages.&#160; Some classes were called things like “TeampriseLogConfiguration” etc etc.&#160; In each case decisions had to be made on individual merit rather than being able to come up with a simple automated cookie cutter approach.</p>  <p>The following is what we ended up with:</p>  <ul>   <li>In the UI, when talking about connecting to Team Foundation Server use that name and the TFS icon.</li>    <li>Packages moved from com.teamprise.* to com.microsoft.tfs.*.</li>    <li>Class names sometimes went from Teamprise* to TFS* or TEE* depending on use, or got a different name entirely.</li>    <li>Eclipse plug-ins moved from com.teamprise.* to com.microsoft.tfs.*.&#160;&#160; We also took the chance to do some refactoring here to make the plug-in names more sensible now that the codebase is much more mature and the roles and responsibilities of each plug-in is better defined than it was back at V1.0 of Teamprise when some of them were originally created.</li>    <li>Extension points moved from com.teamprise.* to the appropriate plug-in com.microsoft.tfs.* based name.&#160; This is important if you were previously using the Teamprise extension points to add integration into our plug-in from yours.&#160; I’ve spoken to the customers and partners that I knew of that were doing this – however I expect more will want to once we make the initial Microsoft release and so we wanted to get the naming right now.</li>    <li>Check-in policies keep their Teamprise based annotation names in version control.&#160; This fact is totally transparent to end users, but means that we retain backwards compatibility with older Teamprise client defined check-in policies.&#160; It also means that partners like JetBrains who have their own check-in policy implementation in the IntelliJ IDE that uses the “Teamprise” scoped mechanism for check-in policy storage need not change their code.</li>    <li>The .tpattributes file lives on as the file that is used to store unix execute bit permissions etc, the .tpignore file lives on as the file you can use to specify resources that Eclipse should ignore.&#160; Again this was for backwards compatibility.&#160; We could have gone down a route where we searched for “.tfsignore” first etc but we’re hoping to be able to reduce the need for these files at some point in the future by making use of the new properties capabilities in TFS 2010 so we decided to leave alone.</li>    <li>In the work item layout target names, “Teamprise” used to be the name of a layout target that was for the Teamprise client.&#160; “Teamprise” is still accepted (for back-compat) but a layout with the target name “JavaSWT” now takes preference.&#160; Therefore when we are looking for a layout target in Eclipse we look for one called:     <br /></li>    <ol>     <li>“JavaSWT”, followed by </li>      <li>“Teamprise” followed by </li>      <li>“WinForms”, followed by </li>      <li>the last unspecified layout.&#160; </li>   </ol> </ul>  <blockquote>   <p>If all this talk of layouts doesn’t mean anything to you then do not worry.&#160; Neno has a <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/vstsblog/archive/2007/08/29/creating-a-separate-work-item-form-layout-for-web-access.aspx">good post here</a> where he talks about using separate layouts for Web Access and Visual Studio where you will get the idea.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Hope that makes sense, we will have a beta out soon where you can take a look for yourself.&#160; The moral of this story is that if you have to re-brand your codebase due to acquisition then be prepared that it will take more thought and effort than you might have originally estimated.</p>

            <p>Since joining Microsoft it has been fantastic to see how committed everyone is to the technology that was acquired from Teamprise.&#160; When Microsoft purchased the Teamprise technology, they also hired all the developers (including me) and are investing heavily not just in the 2010 release but more importantly the long-term future of heterogeneous development using Team Foundation Server.&#160; Since joining Microsoft we’ve grown the team with some fantastic developers (both Software Development Engineers and Software Development Engineers in Test) who we poached from others parts of the company.</p>  <p>We are now after one more person to join our little family. We need someone to help us with our User Education work.&#160; If you know of a technical writer that might be interested in working with us then please send them over to this <a href="https://careers.microsoft.com/JobDetails.aspx?ss=&amp;pg=0&amp;so=&amp;rw=2&amp;jid=10007&amp;jlang=EN">job posting</a> at Microsoft Careers (<a title="https://careers.microsoft.com/JobDetails.aspx?ss=&amp;pg=0&amp;so=&amp;rw=2&amp;jid=10007&amp;jlang=EN" href="https://careers.microsoft.com/JobDetails.aspx?ss=&amp;pg=0&amp;so=&amp;rw=2&amp;jid=10007&amp;jlang=EN">https://careers.microsoft.com/JobDetails.aspx?ss=&amp;pg=0&amp;so=&amp;rw=2&amp;jid=10007&amp;jlang=EN</a>).

        <div class="asset-body">
            <p>Four years ago this month, I joined a small start-up being created called <a href="http://www.teamprise.com" target="_blank">Teamprise</a> after reading about it on <a href="http://www.ericsink.com/" target="_blank">Eric Sink's</a> blog. Our mission was to bring the benefits of application lifecycle management (ALM) with Microsoft Team Foundation Server to everyone. After all, your customers and requirements do not care about the artificial technological borders inside your organisation - so why should your ALM tools?</p>  <p>Today we start a new chapter in the story of accessing Team Foundation Server from Eclipse and non-Windows platforms with the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2009/nov09/11-09TeamprisePR.mspx" target="_blank">announcement that Microsoft has acquired the Teamprise technology</a> and will be releasing a new TFS 2010 targeted version next year.</p>  <p>As part of the deal, I was lucky enough to get offered a position as the Program Manager for this product in Microsoft - a role that I start properly today. As a (now former) Visual Studio MVP I've had a great relationship with the team behind Visual Studio and Team Foundation Server, and I am incredibly excited to move into that very same group. I'm joining a team of people that I consider my friends - a team that consists of some of the smartest people I have ever had the pleasure of working with. </p>  <p>Microsoft has always been committed to creating an ALM solution that was ready to support the entire enterprise and I think this commitment is demonstrated in their decision to support cross-platform and Eclipse clients under their own name. It is also a sign of how clearly the Visual Studio team listens to their customers.</p>  <p>There are obviously going to be some changes along the way, however we're trying to do the best we can to minimise negative impacts. The same core team of developers behind Teamprise is moving to Microsoft to carry on what was going to be Teamprise 4.0. Until Microsoft ships its version, Teamprise 3.3 will continue to be sold and supported by the Teamprise division of SourceGear. If you are an existing Teamprise customer, you will be contacted shortly to help understand what the deal means for you – but the short version is that people with a valid Teamprise 3.3 license and a TFS CAL should be eligible for an upgrade to the new version that will come from Microsoft. That said, feel free to take a look at the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/pathways/teamprise" target="_blank">FAQ</a> to see if this helps, head over to the <a href="http://support.teamprise.com" target="_blank">Teamprise Support forums</a>, or drop me a line at <a href="mailto:martinwo@microsoft.com">martinwo@microsoft.com</a> if you have any questions or concerns that are not being answered and I'll do my best to help.</p>  <p>From a personal point of view, I'll continue to live in rural Northern Ireland as a remote member of the team. I also intend to continue to <a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com" target="_blank">blog</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/martinwoodward" target="_blank">tweet</a>. I'll try to minimize the number of the &quot;wow what a crazy awesome place Microsoft is to work&quot; type posts that you see from new hires - but I probably won't be able to resist the odd one or two.</p>  <p>I'm very excited about all that we will be able to do with the resources of Microsoft behind us. While I officially have the job title of Program Manager, I’ll be heads-down coding for the next few weeks and months and looking forward to seeing what my new team and company come up with next year. </p>  <p>I'll be posting more here as this particular chapter continues, stay tuned – I’m pretty sure the next 12 months are going to be an exciting time!&#160; For more information don’t forget to take a look at <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/bharry/archive/2009/11/09/microsoft-has-acquired-the-teamprise-client-suite.aspx" target="_blank">Brian Harry’s blog post</a> on the topic.</p>

            <p>One of the features in <a href="http://www.teamprise.com">Teamprise 3.3</a> is the ability to connect to a Team Foundation Server 2010 Beta 2 project collection.&#160; The support for TFS 2010 Beta 2 in Teamprise is very similar to the support you will find in a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=CF13EA45-D17B-4EDC-8E6C-6C5B208EC54D">patched Visual Studio 2008 instance</a> – you can connect and work correctly, however some of the new TFS 2010 features will not be available.</p>  <p>The URL syntax in TFS has changed slightly with the 2010 release.&#160; Previously, all URL’s were relative to the root of a server, but with the introduction of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd236915(VS.100).aspx">project collections</a> you have a longer URL in the form of</p>  <blockquote>   <p>http://servername:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection</p> </blockquote>  <p>Where “servername” is the name of your TFS instance, “8080” is the port, “/tfs” is the virtual directory that TFS is installed in and “DefaultCollection” is the name of the project collection you want to connect to.&#160; Like Visual Studio 2008, Teamprise 3.3 cannot connect to the application instance to determine which project collections are available – you have to be provided the name or URL from your TFS administrator.</p>  <p><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; border-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; border-right: 0px" title="tp_connect" border="0" alt="tp_connect" src="http://www.woodwardweb.com/WindowsLiveWriter/ConnectingtoTFS2010Beta2withTeamprise_F7E1/tp_connect_3.png" width="581" height="166" /> </p>  <p>However you can connect now using one of the new URL formats, and if you have a Sharepoint site or a reports site configured their correct locations will be used in Team Explorer.&#160; If you have performed a basic installation of TFS (i.e. with no Sharepoint or Reports services configured) then the Documents and Reports nodes in Team Explorer will just not display.</p>
