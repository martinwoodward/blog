<h3 class="title">JNI on Intel Based Macs</h3>

<p>The day that&nbsp;Intel Macs first started shipping I walked into an Apple store, downloaded <a href="http://www.teamprise.com/">Teamprise</a> and tried to run it to see if it would work.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t that surprised, but I had kinda been hoping that the magic of Rosetta would just take over and automagically make it work.&nbsp; But sadly Rosetta (while clever) isn&rsquo;t that clever.</p>
<p>You see, although on most of the marketing material it says our client is 100% Java, that is not strictly true.&nbsp; It should say 100% java rounded to the nearest percent &ndash; in terms of lines of code we are actually about 99.8% Java with a few small lines of JNI code to call a few (very isolated) native functions.&nbsp; While we seriously did consider a marketing tagline of &ldquo;nearly 100% java&rdquo; or &ldquo;99.8% Java&rdquo;, however we felt that the message would just confuse things.</p>
<p>So &ndash; what are we doing in native code I hear you ask?&nbsp; Well, one thing we are not doing is calling into the Microsoft client libraries for Team Foundation Server access &ndash; some days I wish we were as it would mean a lot less working getting the client to run on Windows.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;when it comes to getting the client running everywhere else we would have been scuppered.&nbsp; Nope, all our Team Foundation Client logic is java talking&nbsp;to the web services running on your Team Foundation Server, meaning that you only need to install our client and you are good to go.</p>
<p>We use native code in a couple of small places:-</p>
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;Advanced&rdquo; File handling.&nbsp; We need to set a read-only file read-write when it gets checked out and we have to work under a 1.4 version of the JRE.&nbsp; While Java 1.4&nbsp;it has a nice file.setReadOnly() method, there is not file.setReadOnly(false) or file.setReadWrite() method so we had to write our own.&nbsp; This is the only real bit of functionality that was must-have for our client that required native code.</li>
<li>Terminal handling.&nbsp; Calculating the number of columns and rows in a console terminal from within the command line client.&nbsp; Had we not have already has a JNI library we probably wouldn&rsquo;t have added one for this, but it makes the command line client environment a lot nicer.</li></ol>
<p>So you see &ndash; including comments and blank lines in&nbsp;the source for our&nbsp;native c code we have less than 300 lines &ndash; less than 0.2 % or our code base at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Of course, our Teamprise Explorer Client uses SWT, which has a great deal of native code in it allowing Java applications to write nice looking and performant GUI&rsquo;s cross-platform.&nbsp; However, the only code we have written falls into one of the two categories above.</p>
<p>Anyway, there is an interesting article over at Apple Developer Connection discussing how to get your <a href="http://developer.apple.com/java/jniuniversal.html">JNI to compile as a universal binary</a>.&nbsp; While&nbsp;our JNI code in our Mac version of the Eclipse Plugin and Command Line Client&nbsp;is compiled as a universal binary, we currently do not officially support the Mac on Intel platform as of version 1.0 &ndash; this is mainly due to the fact that the SWT code at the time we were developing was in the process of being ported to MacIntel.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.edwardthomson.com/blog/">Ed</a>, one of my fellow developers here at <a href="http://www.teamprise.com/">Teamprise</a>, has a <a href="http://www.edwardthomson.com/blog/2006/04/teamprise_on_intel_os_x.html">great article</a> on the topic&nbsp;which explains our reasons for not supporting Intel based Macs as of V1.0.&nbsp; It is something that we are working on and won&rsquo;t be that way for long (in fact, as Ed mentions, if you&nbsp;contact us&nbsp;then we&rsquo;ll send you an&nbsp;unsupported MacIntel build right now).&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I&rsquo;m looking forward to the day when I can take one machine into a demo and show our client running on Mac OS, Windows and Linux &ndash; but we&rsquo;ll have to wait for better virtualization support for the new intel based Mac&rsquo;s until that can happen.</p>
